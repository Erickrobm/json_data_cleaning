42,Notice of Intention to Designate - 505 Balliol Street,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2018-02-16 05:00:00,"Notice of Intention to Designate
Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 505 Balliol Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for DesignationThe property at 505 Balliol Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
DescriptionLocated on the south side of the street between Mount Pleasant Road and Bayview Avenue in the Davisville neighbourhood, the property at 505 Balliol Street contains the Page House and Grocery Store, a one-and-a-half storey, gable-roofed structure completed by 1889 and adapted to function as a neighbourhood store from 1924-1951. The property at 505 Balliol Street was identified as having potential heritage value in the &ldquo;Midtown in Focus: Cultural Heritage Resource Assessment (2017).&rdquo;
Statement of Cultural Heritage ValueThe Page House and Grocery Store has design value as a representative example of the classic 19th century Ontario house which comprised a one-and-a-half storey gable-roofed building with a dormer gable and entrance centred on the principle elevation. It is also valued for the adaptation of the house to include a local neighbourhood grocery store at ground floor which is indicated by the later addition of the two large bay windows on the principal elevation.
As one of the earliest and rare surviving 1880s houses on Balliol Street, the Page House and Grocery Store has historical value for its association with the Page family who occupied the house for over 75 years. It is valued for its association with the Davis family, the historic evolution of the Davisville neighbourhood and the late 19th century subdivision which included the creation of Balliol and Merton streets. It is also valued as it represents a pattern of urban living which evolved in the late 19th century and continued beyond the mid-20th century that relied on the small neighbourhood grocery store on a residential side street, accessible by foot, a common type across the City of Toronto, now increasingly rare.
Contextually the property at 505 Balliol Street supports the remaining historic character of Balliol Street as it developed as a residential street in the late 19th century. In its scale, form and details, the building maintains the link with the original 19th century character of the first houses on the street, the majority of which have been demolished and replaced. In its transformation as a local convenience store, serving the adjacent community connected by the streets perpendicular to Balliol, Forsyth Road, Forman Avenue, Martin Road and Cleveland Street, it is historically and functionally linked to the final development of the Davisville neighbourhood in the early 20th century. As a local community amenity, with its distinctive form and proximity to the street edge, the property is a local landmark.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the building at 505 Balliol Street are:

The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the south side of Balliol Street between Mount Pleasant Road and Bayview Avenue
The scale, form and massing of the one-and-a-half storey house-form building with its gable roof and gable dormer &ndash; this includes the front gable-roofed volume of the house
The principal (north) elevation with its central door flanked by two symmetrical windows with a central gable dormer above
The windows on the principal (north) elevation including the two bay windows and their upper lights and the round-headed dormer window with its one-over-one double-hung sash.
The projecting hipped roof which links the two bay windows together.
The two-over-two double-hung sash window on the second floor of the side (west) elevation
The two-over-two double-hung sash window on the second floor of the side (east) elevation
Original exterior building cladding
The brick chimney on the east elevation

Note: The rear south elevation and the rear wing, all porches and decks are not included in the attributes.

51,Notice of Intention to Designate - 1755 Bayview Avenue,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario ",2018-02-08 05:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 1755 Bayview Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 1755 Bayview Avenue (including the entry address at 1757 Bayview Avenue) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 1755 Bayview Avenue contains a four-unit, two-storey brick and stone-clad apartment building, which is part of a unique set of ten properties of similar design, owned and developed by Henry H. Talbot, builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and designed by the architect W. Breden Galbraith on the east side of Bayview Avenue between Parkhurst Boulevard and Eglinton Avenue East.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1936-37, the four-unit apartment building with a single entrance at 1755 Bayview Avenue has design value as a representative example of a Tudor Revival variation on the Arts and Crafts, the style associated with the Garden Suburb aesthetic, featuring half-timber in the roof gables, paired bay windows with stone bases and long casement windows and a front door with an arched stone surround with a keystone and quoins. The design value of this property is amplified by its being one of the same four-unit apartment building typology with a variety of styles associated with the Arts and Crafts Style, constructed as a set on the east side of Bayview Avenue.
The property is valued for its association with the Leaside Garden Suburb developed in 1912 by the Canadian National Railway and designed by the landscape architect Frederick Todd Gage. It contributes to an understanding of the development and growth of Leaside in the 1930s which integrated a variety of housing typologies addressing various income levels and household types. It demonstrates the variety of the work undertaken by Henry H. Talbot, a locally-based builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and it reflects the work and ideas of the well-known residential designer W. Breden Galbraith.
Contextually, the property at 1755 Bayview Avenue is important in defining and maintaining the consistent character created with the other nine, adjacent, four-unit apartment buildings. Their 1930s period detail, reflecting the Arts and Crafts influence, contributes to and maintains the overall character of the Leaside Garden Suburb. The four-unit apartment buildings maintain not only the period and architectural quality of scale and style but they also contribute to a distinctive social quality in Leaside&rsquo;s planning and built form which provided a wide range of housing typologies.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the building at 1755 Bayview Avenue are:
&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Bayview Avenue between Parkhurst Boulevard and Eglinton Avenue East&bull; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey, four-unit apartment block built on a rectangular plan with projecting bay windows with a unifying roof and a hipped roof with three dormer gables on its principal west elevation&bull; The symmetrical arrangement of the bays on the principal (west) elevation with larger windows and gables flanking the smaller gable, central window and main door&bull; The cladding of the principal (west) elevation with its variegated red brick cladding, stone-clad bays and stone surrounds on the entrance door and half-timbering in the dormer gables with bargeboards with undulating profiles&bull; The windows on the principal (west) elevation with the ground floor bay windows, with five vertical lights divided into square upper sections and rectangular lower sections, the second storey windows with three vertical lights divided into square upper sections and rectangular lower sections and the central second storey window and the decorative pattern of muntin bars in the upper window sections&bull; Decorative wood trim at the eaves above the bay windows including paired wood brackets and a dentil course and the paired wood brackets featured at the second floor level&bull; The single main entrance with its segmentally-arched panelled door with glazed openings surrounded by stone quoins and a keystone&bull; The cladding of variegated red brick on the side elevations and the rusticated concrete block at the raised basement level

Completed in 1888 and attributed to builder Robert Sweet Crabb, the properties were transferred individually to William McLeish, a prominent Toronto realtor, and Charles Powell, manager of the Temperance Colonization Society. 422 and 424 Wellington Street West were listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005 and located in the proposed King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District.Statement of Cultural Heritage ValueThe properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West have cultural heritage value as well-crafted examples of semi-detached house form buildings in the King-Spadina neighbourhood that are distinguished by their Queen Anne Revival styling. The McLeish-Powell Houses are indicative of the style with the picturesque silhouettes, intricate rooflines, variety of fenestration, and mixture of materials that includes decorative terra cotta.The McLeish-Powell Houses have associative value for their contribution to the understanding of the historical evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where they were developed on part of the Military Reserve that was established in the 18th century west of the Town of York and subsequently subdivided and sold in the early 19th century to accommodate the expansion of the City of Toronto. The plan of subdivision incorporated two important public squares (Victoria Memorial Square, with its military burial ground, and Clarence Square) that were connected by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place where the McLeish-Powell Houses were amongst the elaborate residences completed in the late 1800s. The houses were part of the transformation of the King-Spadina neighbourhood from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904. While most of the neighbouring house form buildings were replaced by large-scale warehouses, the McLeish-Powell Houses survived and were converted to commercial and industrial uses in the World War II era. They provide an important reminder of the late-19th century upscale residential appearance of Wellington Place before it was absorbed into the extension of Wellington Street West, west of Spadina Avenue.Contextually, the properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West support the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre. In King-Spadina, the McLeish-Powell Houses reflect the development in the late 1800s of the section of Wellington Street West originally known as Wellington Place as an upscale residential enclave that was enveloped by early 20th century industrial warehouses. Situated in-between warehouse buildings, the McLeish-Powell Houses are historically and visually linked to their surroundings where they are the finest of the small group of surviving 19th-century residential buildings along the thoroughfare.Heritage AttributesThe heritage attributes of the McLeish-Powell Houses on the properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West are:1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the buildings on the north side of Wellington Street West between Spadina Avenue and Portland Street
2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the pair of 2&frac12;-storey semi-detached house form buildings with the rectangular-shaped plans above the stone foundation.
3.&nbsp; The hipped-gable roof covering the buildings with the gabled and hipped dormers, including the trio on the south slope, with the decorative wood bargeboard and brackets
4.&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone, wood and terra cotta detailing
5.&nbsp; The arrangement of the principal (south) elevations of the houses as mirror images, where the main entrances with the flat transoms are placed side-by-side in the centre of the first (ground) floor beneath the pairs of round-arched window openings in the second and attic stories (the doors have been replaced)
6.&nbsp; On the south elevations, in the outer bays, the three-storey bay windows with the segmental-arched and the flat-headed openings
7.&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, which repeat the fenestration, including the three-storey bay windows
8.&nbsp; The detailing on the door and window openings, with the continuous stone lintels and sills, and the brick voussoirs with the stone drip moulds and keystones

The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West contains a 2&frac12;-storey detached house form building that is located on the north side of the street, west of Yonge Street and south of St. Clair Avenue West. It was developed on a subdivision of the former &ldquo;Woodlawn&rdquo; estate along Walker and Woodlawn avenues, which was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1888. The dwelling at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West was constructed in 1906 for Toronto businessman, Stapleton Caldecott and his wife, Emma Arnold Caldecott according to the designs of the notable Toronto architect, Eden Smith. For over 50 years, the site was owned by James H. Swan, whose family had acquired other allotments on Woodlawn Avenue West in the early 20th century.
Statement of Significance
The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is valued for its design as a fine representative example of an early 20th century house form building designed in the Period Revival style influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement as interpreted by architect Eden Smith. It is distinguished by its asymmetrical plan with the projecting bays, the complicated roofline with the gables and the distinctive canted chimneys, and the decorative wood strapwork.
The associative value of the Caldecott House is through its identification with Toronto architect Eden Smith, who designed the dwelling. The English-born architect is noted for his distinctive designs influenced by the Arts and Crafts ideals of William Morris and his circle. In Toronto, following his high-profile commission for St. Thomas&rsquo;s Church (1892) on Huron Street, Smith focused on designing houses in high-end neighbourhoods and enclaves throughout the city, among them Wychwood Park, the neighbourhood inspired by North American artists&rsquo; colonies, which was amongst the first Heritage Conservation Districts in Toronto.
The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is also valued for its association with its original owner, Robert Stapleton Pitt Caldecott (1836-1907), who commissioned the house. Caldecott was a highly regarded businessman who served as the president of the Toronto Board of Trade and was considered an expert in international trade.
Contextually, the Caldecott House is valued for its contribution to the character of the area, which originated as William Hume Blake&rsquo;s 19th-century &ldquo;Woodlawn&rdquo; estate and was developed afterward as an upscale residential enclave that was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1888. The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is also historically, visually and physically linked to its setting where, with its neighbours to the west, the Caldecott House is set back from the street line on a slight rise of land.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Caldecott House at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West are:
&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street
&bull; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey house form building
&bull; The cross-gable roof with the gable on the south slope, the canted brick corner chimneys, and the gabled wall dormer (south)
&bull; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing (the brickwork has been painted), including the wood strapwork in the gables
&bull; The principal (south) elevation, with the main entrance, which is set in a flat-headed surround with sidelights under an open gable-roofed porch between single- and two-storey bay windows
&bull; The side elevations (east and west), which are viewed from Woodlawn Avenue West, including the two-storey bay window on the east wall
Note: the rear (north) wing and the detached garage (1929) at the south end of the property are not identified as heritage attributes.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 2896 Dundas Street West, containing the building originally known as The Molsons Bank, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value. The bank building was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Inventory in 1995.
The property at 2896 Dundas Street West is located at the north side of Dundas Street West, west of Keele Street and contains the a building originally known as The Molsons Bank building. Constructed in 1911, to the designs of the architects Langley &amp; Howland, the two-storey bank building was originally built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof, brick and stone cladding including two stone columns flanked by rusticated piers. In 1936, the Canadian Bank of Commerce (known as CIBC since 1961) purchased the building. In 1954 the building was extended with a rear one-storey wing and renovated interiors to the designs of the architect M. Coleman. In 2002, the property was sold and redeveloped as &ldquo;The Treasury&rdquo; a second-hand store, now a residential property.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The building at 2896 Dundas Street West has design value as a fine example of an early twentieth century bank in the Edwardian Classical style with a beautifully detailed main elevation featuring a stone portico with Tuscan Doric columns and banded piers, arched openings with moulded stone surrounds and an inventive rendering of a traditional entablature and cornice indicating its architects had a sophisticated knowledge of the classical language.
The bank building has historical value as it is associated with the early history and development of the West Toronto Junction as a village and town prior to its amalgamation with the City of Toronto in 1909. It has historic associations with the Molson brewery family, who founded The Molsons Bank in 1853 in Montreal as well as the Canadian Bank of Commerce (later the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce). Both banks were part of the early history of the West Toronto Junction, the emergence of its main street business section as each had opened a branch as early as 1888 and 1893 respectively. The building is valued for its association with the successful Toronto architectural partnership of Langley &amp; Howland whose commissions included branch banks across the city and the province and were also the architects of three other Molsons Bank branches built between 1909 and 1913.
Situated on the north side of Dundas Street West, west of Keele Street, the property at 2896 Dundas Street West has contextual value as it maintains the late19th-early 20th century Main Street pattern of two-three storey buildings with a mix of brick shop-fronts with residential accommodation and monumental stone banks and post offices that characterised the west Junction throughout its history and represents an urban pattern of settlement typical of Main Streets in suburbs and small towns throughout Ontario. The use of stone cladding and full-height columns and piers on the elevation contributes to the streetscape with its grand institutional character and ties in with other Junction bank buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Molsons Bank is one of the landmarks which punctuates the streetscape with its material, forms and details and contributes to the historic character and context of the Junction.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Molsons/CIBC Bank building are:
&bull;The placement and orientation of the building on its property on the north side of Dundas Street West, west of Keele Street
&bull;The setting of the bank building which includes the sidewalk in front of its principal (south) elevation.
&bull;The scale, form and massing of the two-storey, flat-roofed, bank building
&bull;On the principal, south elevation, the arrangement of a three-bay fa&ccedil;ade with a central entrance flanked by windows in the outer bays, with two columns separating the bays and two outer piers at the outer corners
&bull;The primary material cladding of the elevation is limestone
&bull;The stone details include the unfluted Tuscan Doric columns and two broad rusticated piers also with Tuscan Doric capitals all of which are set on a raised bas
&bull;Across the top of the columns and piers is an entablature with a plain frieze with a pair of triglyphs with guttae at each end and a projecting moulded cornice above with mutules on its underside
&bull;At the top of the elevation is a stone balustrade with bulbous balusters between panelled piers whose thickness corresponds to the columns and piers below
&bull;The wall cladding features a smooth ashlar stone which is relieved with rectangular blocks and a continuous moulded string course beneath the upper windows and a relief in the surface with decorative panels below the windows
&bull;On the principal elevation, the ground floor openings feature round headed openings with moulded arch surrounds and keystones for the central door and flanking windows.
&bull;The three upper level windows feature flat-headed, square window openings

Federal Building
The Federal Building meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual values.
Located on the southwest corner of Sheppard Street, the property at 85 Richmond Street West contains the Federal Building, an 11-storey office building that was completed in 1923 by Yolles and Rotenberg, developers and general contractors, according to the design of American architect C. Howard Crane.
Statement of Significance
The Federal Building has design value as a commercial building from the interwar era that is distinguished as a first-generation &ldquo;skyscraper&rdquo; with Beaux-Arts styling while employing contemporary materials and construction methods. It was completed as the largest fire-proof office building in Canada.
The Federal Building is valued for its historical association with the American architect, C. Howard Crane. Following his training with the notable Albert Kahn Associates in Detroit, Crane was recognized internationally for the movie theatres he designed across North America and in Britain. While Crane accepted commissions for other building types in the United States and Canada, the Federal Building is his only documented office building in Canada.
The cultural heritage value of the property at 85 Richmond Street West is also through its connection to Yolles and Rotenberg, the contractors and developers who constructed the Federal Building. The company was co-founded by Louis S. Yolles, who is also distinguished as one of the first practicing Jewish architects in Ontario. Following the completion of the Federal Building, Yolles and his business partner, lawyer Harry Rotenberg commissioned other heritage buildings in the Financial District, including the National Building (1926) at 347 Bay Street, the Sterling Tower (1928) at 372 Bay Street and the Yolles and Rotenberg Building (1954) at 111 Richmond Street West.
The property at 85 Richmond Street West is also linked to the ongoing development of the Financial District in the early 20th century when the area west of Bay Street was laid out according to urban design principles identified with the City Beautiful Movement. A 1911 plan introduced &ldquo;Federal Avenue,&rdquo; a ceremonial boulevard designed to link Union Station with a new public building on Queen Street West. With the outbreak of World War I, the project remained unbuilt, but was recognized in the naming of the Federal Building.
Contextually, the Federal Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on the southwest corner of Richmond and Sheppard streets where it contributes to the character of the Financial District. Placed east of the Yolles and Rotenberg Building (1954) at 111 Richmond Street West, the Federal Building adjoins other landmark skyscrapers located west of Bay Street, including the adjoining Graphic Arts Building (1911) at 73 Richmond Street West, the Concourse Building (1928) at 100 Adelaide Street West, and the Victory Building (1930) at 78 Richmond Street West.
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the Federal Building at 85 Richmond Street West are:
1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of Sheppard Street
2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 11-storey U-shaped plan with the light well (south)
3.&nbsp; The materials, with the concrete construction, the limestone and brick cladding, and the stone, brick and metal detailing

9.&nbsp; The west side elevation, which is viewed from Richmond Street West, and the rear (south) elevation, which is viewed from Sheppard Street

141,Notice of Intention to Designate - 462 Eastern Avenue,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario  462 Eastern Avenue, Notice of Intention to Designate",2018-05-01 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 462 Eastern Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
The property at 462 Eastern Avenue (Brown&rsquo;s Bread Ltd.) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description:
The property at 462 Eastern Avenue is a landmark building located on the north side of Eastern Avenue, on the entire block between Booth and Logan avenues, and contains the two-four storey, red brick-clad bakery complex completed between 1920 and 1929 with various later one to four storey additions at the rear.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:
The Brown&rsquo;s Bread Ltd. complex has design value as a representative example of a well-designed and carefully crafted early twentieth century industrial building. The regular articulation of the exterior elevations with pilaster reflects the internal structural grid typical of factory spaces. The design with its two towers, pilasters shallow pediment(s), and stone details on the pilasters and window sills and at the base demonstrates the attention to aesthetic architectural considerations with which this primary baking facility for Brown&rsquo;s Bread was conceived from the 1920 version through to the additions of 1925, 1926 and 1929.
The property at 462 Eastern Avenue has associative value with the historic origins of Brown&rsquo;s Bread which was established by the baker Louis Brown at the north-east corner of Eastern Avenue and Booth Avenue in 1892 and continued to operate and expand on that site until it merged with Inter City Bakery, and then General Bakeries which was finally acquired by George Weston Ltd. in 1985. Weston continued to operate at this site until 2014. For 120 years this facility represented significant production of baked goods and employment. The property is also valued for its association with the numerous prominent architectural and engineering firms who designed the facility including McGiffin &amp; Smith, architects, Harkness, Loudon &amp; Hertzog, engineers, Sydney Comber, architect and Canadian leader in the design of bakeries, and the Engineering Division of the Chicago-based W. E. Long Company, specialist in all facets of bakery operations from packaging and advertising through to facilities construction.
Contextually, Brown&rsquo;s Bread Ltd. is valued as it maintains the early twentieth century industrial character of Eastern Avenue in south Riverside. Along with the Consumer Gas Buildings on the south side of Eastern Avenue, Brown&rsquo;s Bread is an important architectural landmark in the area representing local industry and employment. It is historically and functionally linked to its surroundings including the adjacent low-rise residential tree-lined streets primarily composed of single-family homes, some as early as the late Victorian period and others dating from the early twentieth century. Together the industrial buildings and residential streets are part of a cohesive neighbourhood which maintains its particular identity established nearly a century ago.
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the property at 462 Eastern Avenue are:
1.&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of Eastern Avenue between Booth and Logan avenues2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the principal four-storey building, with its east and west end bays raised a half storey, and a two-storey, five bay addition to the east.3.&nbsp; The materials, comprising dark red and red brick cladding with stone details4.&nbsp; The brick pilasters on the Booth, Eastern and Logan avenues elevations5.&nbsp; The bands of vertical brick soldier courses running across the tops of window openings and continuing as a decorative band between pilasters6.&nbsp; The stone window sills which span from between the pilasters and have been cut to have angled slopes as well as being blocks at the base of the brick walls7.&nbsp; The stone sills running at the base of the pilasters on all three elevations on Booth, Eastern and Logan avenues8.&nbsp; The stone base at grade, currently painted over9.&nbsp; The stone caps and decorative, triple, vertical stone bands featured at the top of the pilasters with a longer central band10.&nbsp; The shallow pediment at the centre of the four-storey building with its circular stone disk11.&nbsp; The windows on the principal, four-storey building which include wide horizontal windows at the first and second floor levels seen on the elevations facing Booth and Eastern avenue12.&nbsp; The pairs of windows at the third and fourth floor levels of the four-storey building, all floors of the raised east end bay and the two storey addition, on all three elevations facing Booth, Eastern and Logan Avenues13.&nbsp; The pair of vertical windows at the west end of the Eastern Avenue elevation which have been bricked in14.&nbsp; The loading bay opening at the base of the eastern tower and the adjacent ground-level doorwayPlease note: The numerous additions to the rear are not included.

Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue contains a four-unit, two-storey brick and stone-clad apartment building, which is the most northern property in a unique set of ten properties of similar design, owned and developed by Henry H. Talbot, builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and designed by the architect W. Breden Galbraith on the east side of Bayview Avenue north of Parkhurst Boulevard and south of Eglinton Avenue East. Metrolinx declared it a Provincial Heritage Property on June 8, 2016.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1936-37, the four-unit apartment building with a single entrance at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue has design value as a representative example of a Tudor Revival variation on the Arts and Crafts, the style associated with the Garden Suburb aesthetic, featuring, paired bay windows with stone bases, a row of four double hung sash windows and a front door with a Tudor arch stone surround with a keystone and quoins. The design value of this property is amplified by its being one of the same four-unit apartment building typology with a variety of styles associated with the Arts and Crafts Style, constructed as a set on the east side of Bayview Avenue.
The property is valued for its association with the Leaside Garden Suburb developed in 1912 by the Canadian National Railway and designed by the landscape architect Frederick Todd Gage. It contributes to an understanding of the development and growth of Leaside in the 1930s which integrated a variety of housing typologies addressing various income levels and household types. It demonstrates the variety of the work undertaken by Henry H. Talbot, a locally-based builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and it reflects the work and ideas of the well-known residential designer W. Breden Galbraith.
Contextually, the property at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue is important in defining and maintaining the consistent character created with the other nine, adjacent, four-unit apartment buildings. Their 1930s period detail, reflecting the Arts and Crafts influence, contributes to and maintains the overall character of the Leaside Garden Suburb. The four-unit apartment buildings maintain not only the period and architectural quality of scale and style but they also contribute to a distinctive social quality in Leaside&rsquo;s planning and built form which provided a wide range of housing typologies.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the building at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue are:
&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Bayview Avenue between Parkhurst Boulevard and Eglinton Avenue East&bull; The scale, form and massing of the hipped roof, two-storey, four-unit apartment block built on a rectangular plan with two projecting bay windows with hipped roofs flanking a central entrance on the principal (west) elevation&bull; The cladding of the principal (west) elevation with its variegated red brick, the stone cladding of the bays which extends up to the first floor windows&bull; Material details include the stone belt courses which double as window sills, stone trim around the door, vertical brick headers over the first floor windows and wood trim beneath the broad, over-hanging eaves of the roof over the second floor windows&bull; The windows on the principal (west) elevation with the bay windows at both levels featuring a row of four double-hung sash with four vertical lights over a single light, two windows in the sides of the bays and the central second storey double hung sash with six lights over one.&bull; The single main entrance with its wide Tudor arch with stone quoins and a keystone framing a glazed door with a pointed head and sidelights&bull; The cladding of variegated red brick on the side and rear elevations (north and south and east respectively) and the rusticated concrete block at the raised basement level

Reasons for Designation
The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (specifically the portion with the entrance address at 25 Liberty Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue is located on the southwest corner of Atlantic and Liberty and contains a 3&frac12;-storey industrial building (known for convenience purposes as 25 Liberty Street) that was constructed in 1901 according to the plans of the Toronto architectural firm of G. M. Miller and Company. It formed part of the manufacturing complex developed in 1898 and afterward by the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company for the production of windmills, steel towers, pumps, motors, and other equipment, particularly for railway companies and farmers. The company remained a fixture in the neighbourhood now known as Liberty Village for 40 years.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) has design value as a well-crafted example of an industrial building that was designed after the turn of the 20th century when Edwardian Classicism was emerging as the most popular architectural style. Exhibiting the restrained brick detailing and classical features identified with the style, the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building is particularly distinguished by the corbelled brickwork beneath the roofline, as well as the distinctive oriel windows that overlook Atlantic Avenue and Liberty Street.
The cultural heritage value of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building is also through its associations with the Toronto architectural practice of G. M. Miller and Company, which designed it. Headed by George Martel Miller who opened a solo practice in 1886, his firm was best known for the many projects it undertook for members of Toronto&rsquo;s famous Massey family, which produced agricultural implements for international distribution and funded philanthropic projects in the city. Miller was the supervising architect for the Massey (Music) Hall before completing alterations to the Massey-Harris Company&rsquo;s office building to the west on King Street West near Strachan Avenue. He designed the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company&rsquo;s complex over the period from 1898 to 1910, including the former factory (1901) at 25 Liberty Street.
The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) is valued for its contributions to the historical development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of the community adjoining the southeast corner of King Street West and Dufferin Street as an important industrial centre at the west end of Toronto. With the adjacency of two railway lines and the subdivision and servicing of the land, the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company was one of the first manufacturers to build its factory in the area where it operated for 40 years.
The contextual value of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building (1901) is through its role in defining, maintaining and supporting the character of the former manufacturing enclave in the area southeast of King Street West and Dufferin Street where it is part of an important surviving collection of industrial buildings, many of which are included on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register. The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) is also valued contextually for its visual and historical links to its surroundings in the neighbourhood now known as Liberty Village where it anchors an important intersection on the main east-west route through the community. In this location, the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building faces the St. David&rsquo;s Wine Growers Company Building at 60 Atlantic Avenue, which it complements in vintage and scale, and overlooks to the northeast the landmark boiler house and smokestack of the former Brunswick-Balke-Collender complex at 40 Hanna Avenue, which are other recognized heritage properties in Liberty Village.
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building on the property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) are:
&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of Atlantic Avenue and Liberty Street&bull; The scale, form and massing of the building, with the rectangular plan that rises three stories above a base with window openings&bull; The red brick cladding with brick, stone and wood detailing&bull; The flat roof with the brick chimney on the west end&bull; The principal (north) elevation on Liberty Street, which is divided into three bays by brick pilasters&bull; The main (north) entrance, which is set in the right (west) bay under a classical pediment with oversized brackets&bull; The fenestration on the principal (north) elevation, with the segmental-arched window openings that are arranged in pairs in the three stories, the oversized segmental-arched window opening in the centre of the first (ground) floor, and the oriel window in the second storey&bull; On the long east elevation on Atlantic Avenue, which extends 11 bays, the continuation of the fenestration from the north elevation, including the oriel window in the second storey&bull; The rear (south) elevation, where the door and window openings are organized by brick pilasters&bull; The detailing on all of the elevations, with the corbelled brickwork beneath the roofline, the brick flat arches and stone sills on the window openings, and the oversized wood brackets on the oriel windows (north and east) that overlook the intersection of Liberty and Atlantic
The west elevation is almost completely concealed by the adjoining buildings at 35 Liberty Street.

Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 50 King Street East under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 50 King Street East (including the entrance address at 2 Toronto Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 50 King Street East anchors the northwest corner of the intersection of King and Toronto streets and contains a 5-storey commercial building that was completed in 1887 for the Quebec Bank, the Montreal institution that opened a number of branches in Ontario. Toronto architect, D. B. Dick prepared the plans for the building, which was extended by a complementary west addition. Following a fire in the 1940s, the Quebec Bank was restored and the west addition reconstructed. The site was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s inaugural Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1973. It is located in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District, which was adopted by City Council in 2015.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 50 King Street East has cultural heritage value for its design as a well-crafted late-19th century commercial building that displays the red brick construction above the extended stone base, the polychromatic detailing and the archetypical round-arched motif associated with the late-19th century Romanesque Revival style. The primary elevations (south and east) are distinguished by the tripartite organization, the arcades organizing the window openings between the base and the attic, and the decorative brick, stone and terra cotta detailing.
The Quebec Bank is historically associated with the notable architect, D. B. Dick, who designed the building in 1886. Born and trained in Scotland, Dick worked with the distinguished Edinburgh firm of Peddie and Kinnear, which purportedly inspired his Romanesque Revival designs in Toronto where he relocated in 1873. After working with Scottish expatriate, Robert Grant, in 1876 Dick established a solo practice that resulted in ongoing commissions for the Consumers&rsquo; Gas Company, industrialist William Davies, and the University of Toronto, including the restoration of University College in the 1890s.
The associative value of the property at 50 King Street East is also through its contribution to an understanding of the development and significance of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood as it evolved from its origins as &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo; and survived the Great Fire of 1849 as the commercial and institutional heart of Toronto. Within this community, the Quebec Bank was part of the area along King and Toronto streets that was the hub of banking, insurance companies and utilities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries prior to the shift of the financial district west of Yonge Street. While the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood underwent an economic downturn in the 20th century before it was revitalized in the 1960s, the Quebec Bank remained and reflects the late 19th century vibrancy and the continuing vitality of the city&rsquo;s oldest community and neighbourhood.
The property at 50 King Street East is also associated with Sir Henry Mill Pellatt (1859-1939) who owned the property between 1911 and 1921. While best known for commissioning &ldquo;Casa Loma&rdquo; as his private residence in Toronto, Pellatt was noted for his involvement in banking, the Toronto Stock Exchange, insurance companies and resource development. He is remembered as the co-founder of the Electrical Development Company of Ontario, which introduced electricity to Toronto for street lighting and the street railway prior to the enterprise&rsquo;s acquisition by the forerunner to Ontario Hydro. With his role in business ventures across Canada and beyond, by the World War I era when he acquired the property at 50 King Street East, Pellatt was identified among the country&rsquo;s leading financiers.
Contextually, the property at 50 King Street East contributes to the character of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood, which is distinguished as the birthplace of Toronto where Old Town was situated and King Street was extended westward as the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; in the 19th century. With its setting on King Street East, the Quebec Bank contributes to an important surviving collection of 19th- and 20th-century commercial and institutional buildings, among them the neighbouring King Edward Hotel (1903), opposite, and St. James&rsquo; Cathedral (1851) to the east. Anchoring the northwest corner of King and Toronto streets, the Quebec Bank marks the entrance to Toronto Street with its important collection of 19th-century edifices, including the Seventh Post Office (1853), the National Historic Site at 10 Toronto Street, and the Consumers&rsquo; Gas Company offices (1876 ff.) at 17 and 19 Toronto Street, which are recognized heritage properties.

171,Notice of Intention to Designate - 1132 Broadview Avenue,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2018-05-18 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 1132 Broadview Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 1132 Broadview Avenue, known as the Salvation Army Broadview Village (SABV), which contains the coach house that was originally part of the Taylor-Davies families&rsquo; Chester Park estate, and the later administrative and three residential buildings which are part of the SABV, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 1132 Broadview Avenue is located on the west side of Broadview Avenue, north of Pottery Road and contains a collection of buildings relating to three distinct periods and history of use on the remaining 2.5 acres of the original 40-acre Chester Park Estate property. The first period dating from 1881-1940 is associated with the residential use of the property by the Taylor and Davies families. The remaining building from this time is a one-and-a-half storey coach house with a truncated hipped roof on the main building and an adjacent flat-roofed, single-storey wing.
The second period, 1940-1967, is associated with the adaptive re-use of the house and coach house by the Salvation Army as a children&rsquo;s home. In 1961, the coach house was renovated for residential use.
In the third period, new buildings were added to the property including three, split-level two-storey &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; (1967) with low-pitched gable roofs. When the cottages were added in 1967 they were arranged to maintain the original driveway and the view from Broadview Avenue of the Coach house. At that time the proposed new administration building was designed to surround and maintain the original 1880s house. It was only in 1976, that the decision was made to demolish the house when funding for the administration building was received. The new two storey, split-level, administration building (1976) with a central, mono-pitch roof section with adjacent flat-roofs. a residential wing also with a mono-pitched roof, and a flat-roofed addition (2010) which provided a new entry and an elevator. The buildings are clad in mottled red, orange, grey and brown brick except for the addition which is clad in brown brick. From the mid-1990s to the present the property was used as a home for adults.
Recognition
The coach house was included on the Inventory of Historical Buildings in East York, by the East York Historical Society in 1993 and received a plaque from the East York Historical Society with assistance from the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Culture and the Salvation Army.
In 2006 it was included on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Inventory now known as the Heritage Register.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Salvation Army Broadview Village has design and physical value which is evident in the original Chester Park coach house and the Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman Building. The coach house has design value as a representative example of a late 19th century coach house building with a truncated hipped roof, symmetrical dormers and fine craftsmanship evident in the brick relief details including the segmental arched openings with raised voussoirs and the quoins.
The SABV administration building has design value as a representative example of a Post-War Modernist style institutional building which displays artistic merit in its combination of traditional and modernist elements which balance the dignity of an institution with a more progressive social agenda aimed at creating nurturing residential environments for children.
The SABV has historical value as an evolving campus first functioning from the 1880s as the grand estate home of the Taylor and Davies families who were significant to the community as important contributors to the development of the Todmorden Mills and the Don Valley Brick Works as well as to the growth and prosperity of the former borough of East York and the City of Toronto. From 1940, the property has been associated with the social and community outreach work that has been fundamental to the historic origins of the Salvation Army, who purchased the property in 1940 to accommodate their girl&rsquo;s home known as &ldquo;The Nest,&rdquo; previously located at 450 Pape Avenue.
From that time it has evolved to accommodate young boys, older youth and from the mid-1990s adults. The property is also significant for its association with Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman who are commemorated in the naming of the 1976 administration building and who had been generous benefactors of the Salvation Army. Known for his leadership from the 1920s in the Lions Club and his support for youth and community leadership, the Harry A. Newman Foundation continues to be a supporter of programs at various Toronto universities and colleges as well as individual institutions.
The property has contextual value as an evolved estate property supporting both the late 19th and mid-twentieth century character of the Broadview North neighbourhood. Situated at the rear western edge of the property at 1132 Broadview Avenue and viewed from the street and the main entrance along the driveway, the coach house is important for maintaining the original 19th century character of the area which featured many large estates with homes constructed by the Taylor and Davies families as well as to their businesses in the valley below preserved at the Todmorden Mills and Don Valley Brickworks sites. It contributes to the residential character of the neighbourhood including the adjacent Hillside Drive. The coach house is physically and historically linked to its surroundings.
Facing the west side of Broadview Avenue the Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman Building is important in maintaining and supporting the character and scale of the area with its low height, residential character and its set back from the street. A part of the neighbourhood since 1976, it is historically and functionally linked to the evolution of Broadview North which following the subdivision of the Taylor and Davies&rsquo;s estates gradually incorporated smaller-scale residential properties as well as community institutions and social agencies.
With the Chester Park coach house and the Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman Building, the property is a landmark in the Broadview North neighbourhood.

&bull; The placement and orientation of the building on the property on the west side of Broadview Avenue, north of Pottery Road, facing the end of the driveway which leads from Broadview Avenue to the coach house.&bull; The scale, form and massing of the building which includes a principal one-and-a-half-storey main section with a truncated, hipped roof and eight dormers and to the south a one-storey flat-roofed wing&bull; The orange-red brick cladding with its fine relief detailing of segmental arched openings with three raised voussoirs and the quoins at the corners on all elevations and the stone/composite stone sills on all window openings&bull; On the principal, east elevation, the remaining remnants of four arched-headed openings &ndash; two modified to accommodate a new higher windows and a door with glazed surrounds, two bricked-in but with the voussoirs still intact, and two small arches still retaining their original configuration for a door and a narrow window&bull; On the south, side elevation, the openings on the ground floor level which include the two windows on the wing with their a transom light over three vertical lights, and on the original carriage house the original high level window with the segmental arched head and the adjacent window opening which has been extended to accommodate a door&bull; On the west, rear, elevation the openings on the ground floor level which include on the wing, four equally spaced segmentally arched openings, three with high level windows and one extended to accommodate a door and on the main coach house building five arched headed window openings of varying height and length&bull; On the north, side, elevation, the four, high, segmentally arched openings (currently filled in) and the single glazed opening&bull; The eight dormers, three on the east elevation, three on the west and one facing south and one facing north all symmetrically arranged within the truncated hipped roof.

206,Notice of Intention to Designate - 771 Yonge Street,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act,  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2018-09-18 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 771 Yonge Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 771 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the southeast corner of Asquith Avenue, the property at 771 Yonge Street contains a three-storey commercial building that, according to archival records, was constructed in 1872 for property owner Elizabeth French and operated as a hotel by her husband, Joseph French. Following his death, a series of hostelries occupied the property, including the Langston House and the CPR Hotel. Among the occupants in the 20th century was Boris Volkoff&rsquo;s first dance studio in Toronto. The property at 771 Yonge Street was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Property (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1984.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 771 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value for its design as an important surviving example in Yorkville of a late 1800s commercial building with the symmetry and gable roof retained from the Georgian style linked to first-generation commercial edifices in Toronto. Its late-19th century vintage is apparent in the scale and elaborate corbelled brickwork along the Yonge Street elevation.
French&rsquo;s Hotel is valued for its historical association with the Village of Yorkville (1853-1883), which was an independent municipality prior to its annexation by the City of Toronto. The subject building was part of the commercial district along Yonge Street that served the brickyards, breweries and related industries that formed the basis of the community. As a hotel in operation for more than 40 years, French&rsquo;s Hotel was one of a selection of hostelries located near the key intersection of Yonge and Bloor streets where a tollgate once adjoined the boundary between Toronto and Yorkville.
The property at 771 Yonge Street is also valued as the location of the first dance studio in Toronto opened by the famed Russian-born dancer, choreographer, director and teacher, Boris Volkoff (1900-1974), who was revered as the &ldquo;father of Canadian ballet.&rdquo; With premises at 771 Yonge from 1930 to 1945 and while training innumerable dancers, Volkoff founded the Volkoff Canadian Ballet as the forerunner to a professional ballet company in Canada, and worked on co-productions with the Toronto Opera Company (forerunner of today&rsquo;s Canadian Opera Company).
Contextually, French&rsquo;s Hotel contributes to the character of Yonge Street, north of Bloor Street, where it reflects the evolution of the area in the late 19th century as it evolved from an incorporated village to a city neighbourhood along the important corridor known as Toronto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street.&rdquo; French&rsquo;s Hotel is also historically, visually and physically linked to its surrounding on Yonge Street where it anchors the southeast corner of Asquith Avenue and, with the contiguous row of late-19th century commercial buildings on the west side of the street between Cumberland Street and Yorkville Avenue, marks the east entry into the commercial centre of the former Village of Yorkville.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the commercial building at 771 Yonge Street are:
1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Asquith Avenue
2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan
3.&nbsp; The gable roof with the parapets with brackets (north and south) and, along the west end, the corbelled brickwork with the dentils and the band courses (the brick end chimneys have been removed)
4.&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing (the red brickwork has been painted)
5.&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation where, above the first-floor storefront (which has been altered) the symmetrically-arranged segmental-arched window openings with the stone sills and the brick flat arches
6.&nbsp; The north side elevation on Asquith Avenue, with the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched window openings in the upper stories with the brick and stone detailing (on the north and south elevations, the window openings in the attic level have been bricked in)Note: the south side elevation adjoins the neighbouring building. The rear (east) wall and the two-storey east wings are not identified as heritage attributes.

&nbsp;
495 King Street West
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation:
The property at 495 King Street West (Conboy Carriage Company &ndash; rear wing) is worthy of designation for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description:
The property at 495 King Street West is located on the south side of King Street West, between Spadina Avenue and Portland Place and contains the Conboy Carriage Company rear wing which was added to Daniel Conboy&rsquo;s property and manufacturing complex in 1900. The building is a three-storey warehouse type, brick clad with regular rows of windows on the north and south elevations and new windows on the east elevation added during alterations in 1990.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:
The property at 495 King Street West, the rear wing of the Conboy Carriage Co., has design value as a representative example of a commercial warehouse building dating to the late 19th-early 20th century that is typical of the King Spadina neighbourhood. The long rectangular plan of the three-storey building with windows on the long sides, brick cladding and brick piers, expressive of the internal post and beam structure, are characteristic features of the building type.
&nbsp;
The rear wing of the Conboy Carriage Co. has historical value as it contributes to an understanding of the development of the King Spadina neighbourhood as it was transformed from being primarily institutional and residential in the first three quarters of the 19th century to being one of the City&rsquo;s prime industrial centres following the Great Fire of 1904. Located on a property that once extended behind Daniel Conboy&rsquo;s residential property, the wing has direct associations with Daniel Conboy and indicates the steady expansion and success of his enterprise prior to its relocation to the east side of the Don River south of Queen Street in 1907.
&nbsp;
The rear wing has contextual value as it contributes to defining and maintaining the late 19th-early 20th century commercial/industrial scale and character of the King Spadina HCD. Its brick clad, narrow, three storey rectangular mass contributes to the typical scale, but its location at the rear of the block, set perpendicularly to the Conboy building is atypical adding variety to the configuration of the open space surrounding the typical blocks with their narrow end elevations facing the street with adjacent narrow alleys.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the property at 495 King Street West are:
&nbsp;
&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the warehouse building at the rear of the lot perpendicular to the Conboy Carriage Co. building at 485 King Street West&bull; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey rectangular block&bull; The brick cladding with the regularly spaced brick piers on all four elevations&bull; The pairs of windows between the brick piers on the north and south elevation&bull; The absence of openings on the west elevation&bull; The brick detailing including the stepped bricks at the cornice and the segmental-arched openings and the stepped brick corbelling at the north-east corner of the building between the first and second floor levels&bull; The stone window sills
&nbsp;
519 King Street West
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation:
The property at 519 King Street West (part of the J. C. Musson Block) is worthy of designation for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The property at 519 King Street West is part of a group of five properties located on the south side of King Street West, between Spadina Avenue and Portland Place comprised of the J. C. Musson Block which was constructed by John C. Musson in 1885 as part of his development of Plan M26. The building is a three-storey commercial row originally containing six units with residential accommodation on the upper two floors and is distinguished by the craftsmanship evident in the detailing of the brick cladding.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
As part of the J. C. Musson block located at 519-529 King Street West, the property at 519 King Street West has design value as a fine representative of the rare Neo-Grec style expressed on a commercial block type of (originally) six units including residential accommodation. The three-storey, rectangular block exhibits a high degree of craftsmanship as well as artistic merit in the brick detailing which, in its expression of structure with the brick piers, segmental arches and stone imposts and without any reference to a historic architectural style, is a fine representation of the Neo-Grec style.
The property at 519 King Street West, as part of the J.C Musson Block, has historical value for its potential to yield information about the King Spadina neighbourhood and particularly about the period of the district between 1880 and 1900 which had a greater predominance of residential properties. The Block represents a building typology associated with a commercial main street adjacent to a residential neighbourhood which was part of the original development of Plan M26 undertaken by John C. Musson in 1885 and remains an indication of one of the characteristic periods in the continual historic transformation of this neighbourhood since its establishment as the Garrison Common to New Town to industrial sector and finally to a revitalized arts and entertainment district which continues to evolve. The Block is also valued as one of the many projects undertaken by John C. Musson in the late 19th century on King Street West which contributed to the development of the city.
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1885, as part of a three-storey commercial block with brick and stone cladding, the property at 519 King Street West contributes to the contextual value and character of the King Spadina HCD by maintaining the period, scale and texture which defines this portion of King Street West. It adds to the variety of a district predominantly characterized by warehouses as a commercial main street building type, well established on Toronto&rsquo;s other historic main street arteries, and typically associated with a more residential neighbourhood and therefore representative of the 1880-1900 period of the HCD. The richly detailed elevation facing the main street contributes to the high quality of design featured on the adjacent warehouse buildings constructed between 1875 and 1925 in the King Spadina HCD.
&nbsp;

The heritage attributes of the property at 519 King Street West are:
&nbsp;
&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building as part of the J. C.

&nbsp;

214,Notice of Intention to Designate - 295 Indian Road,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario, 295 Indian Road",2018-09-05 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 295 Indian Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Paul Hahn House
Reasons for Designation
The property at 295 Indian Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 295 Indian Road contains a 2&frac12;-storey detached house form building that is located on the east side of the street between Boustead and Radford avenues, south of Bloor Street West.&nbsp; Located on Indian Road, which was laid out by architect John George Howard to access his &ldquo;Sunnyside&rdquo; farm, the dwelling at 295 Indian Road was constructed in 1906 for Toronto musician and businessman, Paul Hahn according to the designs of the notable Toronto architect, Eden Smith.&nbsp; It was part of an artistic enclave that developed on Indian Road by enthusiasts of the Arts and Crafts movement before Eden Smith and many of his neighbours relocated to Wychwood Park.
Statement of Significance
The property at 295 Indian Road is valued for its design as a fine representative example of an early-20th century house form building designed in the Period Revival style influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement as interpreted by architect Eden Smith.&nbsp; As one of the architect&rsquo;s trademark &ldquo;turned-about&rdquo; houses that placed the main entrance on the wing, rather than the front of the building facing the street, its design is further distinguished by the complicated roofline with the tall chimney and, on the interior, the inglenook on the first (ground) floor.
Historically, the property at 295 Indian Road is linked to the development of the street by the early Toronto architect, John George Howard, on his &ldquo;Sunnyside&rdquo; farm east of his famed &ldquo;High Park&rdquo; estate.&nbsp; To access his property, Howard laid out Indian Road as a meandering route, purportedly inspired by an aboriginal trail, which represented a departure from the grid pattern of streets in Toronto and complemented the adjoining finely-crafted residential district introduced later in the late-19th and early-20th century.
The associative value of the Paul Hahn House is through its identification with the significant Toronto architect Eden Smith, who designed the dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp; The English-born architect is noted for his distinctive designs influenced by the Arts and Crafts ideals of William Morris and his circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Toronto, following his high-profile commission for St. Thomas&rsquo;s Church (1892) on Huron Street, Smith focused on designing houses in high-end neighbourhoods and enclaves throughout the city, completing his own house and others (including the subject property) on Indian Road before relocating to Wychwood Park, which was amongst the first Heritage Conservation Districts in Toronto.
The property at 295 Indian Road is also valued for its association with its original owner, Paul Hahn (1875-1962), who commissioned the house.&nbsp; A member of a famous artistic family, Hahn was a celebrated cellist, music teacher and ornithologist in Toronto who opened a self-named piano store on Yonge Street in 1913 that remains in operation over a century later.
Contextually, the Paul Hahn House is valued for its contribution to the character of the area, which was founded in the 1840s as Toronto architect John George Howard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunnyside&rdquo; farm, which he developed east of his &ldquo;High Park&rdquo; estate.&nbsp; Howard laid out Indian Road where, in the late-19th and early-20th century the adjoining lands were the setting for an upscale artists&rsquo; enclave with the custom-designed residences that architect Eden Smith designed for himself, Paul Hahn and other members of Toronto&rsquo;s artistic community.
The property at 295 Indian Road is also historically, visually and physically linked to its setting where it is adjoined by the Eden Smith House (1896) to the south and two dwellings on neighbouring Boustead Avenue dating to the early 1900s that were designed by Eden Smith for fellow supporters of the Arts and Crafts movement.&nbsp; The latter properties are recognized on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Paul Hahn House at 295 Indian Road are:
1.&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of the street between Boustead and Radford avenues2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey house form building3.&nbsp; The combined gabled, hipped and canted roofline with the hipped dormers (north and east), the flat-headed opening in the south gable and, on the north end, the tall brick chimney with the corbelled brickwork near the base4.&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing5.&nbsp; The L-shaped plan, where the main entrance is placed on the south side of the L in a flat-arched surround with the original panelled wood door with the glass insert (the glass has been replaced)6.&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the north and south side elevations and the rear (east) elevation, the fenestration with the segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings that contain single or multiple windows and, on the rear (east) elevation, the surviving bay window with the hipped roof and wood detailing7.&nbsp; The secondary entrance on the north side elevation with the wood detailing8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enclosed verandah at the southeast corner (originally open, it is part of the evolution of the building)9.&nbsp; On the interior, the inglenook with the brick fireplace and hearthNote: The current enclosed porch protecting the main entrance is a complimentary addition. The rear (east) entrance is an alteration.&nbsp; Neither is identified as a heritage attribute.
Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2N2 within thirty days of September 5, 2018, which is October 5, 2018.

&nbsp;
McBurney &amp; Saunders Row House
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 37 Mutual Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of the street south of Shuter Street and adjacent to the mid-19th century heritage properties at 79, 81 and 85 Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood, the property at 37 Mutual Street is part of a group of four two-and-a-half-storey Second Empire-style row houses that were completed in 1890 by developers Jackson A. McBurney and Joseph Saunders, and first occupied by members of the city&rsquo;s new middle class.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 37 Mutual Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets the criteria for municipal designation prescribed by the Province of Ontario under the three categories of design, associative and contextual values.
The property at 37 Mutual Street is valued for its design and construction as part of the intact row of four two-and-a-half storey house form buildings at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street, dating to 1890 and displaying a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit. They are also valued as fine examples of the Second Empire Style, which was featured in some of the grand estates on the adjacent Jarvis Street, and emulated in the design of middle-class row houses on neighbouring streets like Mutual Street. The elements of the style are seen primarily in the Mansard roof and in the rich elaboration of well-preserved brickwork and wooden architectural elements evident at the windows and cornices. The row house type is represented in the two-and-a-half storey building on a raised basement. All four principal elevations have nearly identical arrangements, though every other facade is reversed, rather than simply repeating. This lends a symmetry to adjacent units, and to the overall composition. Other features of the group include the round-arched main entrance, set to one side, with the similarly round-arched window adjacent at the first floor level. Combined with the alternating pattern of each dwelling, this articulation creates a pleasing massing pattern that unifies the group. Within the Garden District, the group of four dwellings at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street comprise a very well-preserved example of this aspirational row house type that emerged in the last quarter of the 19th century as representative of the tastes and means of the city&rsquo;s new middle class.
&nbsp;
As part of the group of four two-and-a-half storey row houses at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street, the property at 37 Mutual Street is also valued for its contribution to an understanding of the historical development of this part of the Garden District neighbourhood, which was transformed through John G. Howard&rsquo;s late 1840s design from a single family estate to a dense urban neighbourhood. Initially, the subject properties were a part of one of the series of hundred acre Park Lots, created with the founding of the town of York in 1793 and granted to the influential Jarvis family. Its subdivision included the creation of Jarvis Street, an extraordinarily wide, grand avenue where influential and wealthy Torontonians built their estates and which provided a connection from the Second Concession Line (Bloor Street) southward to the town&rsquo;s commercial and civic institutions and lakefront wharves. Mutual Street, in contrast, represents a residential enclave developed for the middle class, adjacent to the grand Jarvis Street estates.
&nbsp;
Contextually the property at 37 Mutual Street is valued for its role as part of the group of four row houses at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street in defining, maintaining and supporting the historical character of the Garden District. This character was defined in the last quarter of the 19th century with row houses and semi-detached houses of a consistent scale and built form which featured two-and-a-half storey dwellings, on raised basements, with sloping attic roofs expressed as gable, hips or mansards. Within the context of a neighbourhood in flux due to ongoing development pressure, the property at 37 Mutual Street is valued as part of the group of four row houses for its historic, physical and visual links with its surroundings for nearly 130 years.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 37 Mutual Street are:
&nbsp;
1.&nbsp; The location, set back and orientation of the building as the southern anchor of a group of four row houses on the east side of Mutual Street2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the building with its two-and-a-half storey height and L-shaped plan on a raised basement with a mansard roof and brick corbelled firebreak wall3.&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its round-arched windows and door openings, paired windows at the second floor and paired, hipped dormer windows in the mansard roof4.&nbsp; The materials with the orangey-red brick with brick detailing, rough-hewn sandstone of the raised basements, slate shingles in a rectangular and rosette pattern, the decorative wood detailing of the dormer windows, console brackets below the roof eaves, and detailing of the mansard roof and soffits at both the second and third floor levels5.&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the stained-glass transom in the round-arched window
&nbsp;
Note: the metal cladding covering the slate hipped roofs of the two roof dormers is not considered a heritage attribute

229,Amendment of Designating By-law 758-79 – 517 Wellington Street West,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2018-08-29 04:00:00,"Take notice that City Council intends to amend former City of Toronto By-law 758-79, a by-law designating the properties at 495-517 Wellington Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, to update the cultural heritage values and attributes according to the 2005 amendments to the Ontario Heritage Act.
Now known as 517 Wellington Street West (with entrance addresses at 495 Wellington Street West, 31 Portland Street and 501 Front Street West), the Copp Clark Company Complex meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Located on the southeast corner of Wellington and Portland Streets in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 517 Wellington Street West contains a complex of buildings commissioned by the Copp Clark Company Limited (later known as the Copp Clark Publishing Company). At the east end of the site, the building identified by the entrance address of 495 Wellington Street West comprises a three-storey factory building with a two-storey rear (south) wing dating to 1909 that was extended to the south by a three-storey addition built in 1928. Directly west, the four-storey office and warehouse building was completed in 1912. All the buildings were designed by the Toronto architectural partnership of Wickson and Gregg. The property at 517 Wellington Street West was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1974 and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1979 by By-law 758-79. In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017. In 2018, the HCD was under appeal The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 517 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 517 Wellington Street West has cultural heritage value for its design as a complex of early 20th century industrial buildings sharing complementary Edwardian Classical detailing from the most popular style of the pre-World War I era. Identified by its somber red brick work, symmetrical appearance and restrained classical detailing, Edwardian Classicism was particularly popular for industrial buildings, including the Copp Clark Company Complex. The style is evident on the factory building (1909) where the north elevation on Wellington Street West incorporates a frontispiece with a parapet and stone detailing that contains a classically-detailed entrance at its base. Directly west, the larger combined office building and warehouse (1912) is viewed from both Wellington and Portland streets and is particularly distinguished by the treatment of the corners with the oversized piers and the stepped parapets, the stone embellishments along the north and west rooflines, and the cornice that continues from the north to the west elevation.
The Copp Clark Company Complex is valued for its association with the Toronto architectural firm of Wickson and Gregg, which designed all of the buildings. Headed by A. Frank Wickson and Alfred Holden Gregg, the partners opened their practice in 1905 and received immediate acclaim for their design for the Carnegie-funded Central Reference Library at College and St. George streets (completed in 1909 in association with architect A. H. Chapman) and Timothy Eaton Memorial Church and Sunday School (1911-1913) on St. Clair Avenue West. Both had previous experience designing factories and warehouses in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which continued with the Turnbull Elevator Company Building (1906) on John Street, a trio of buildings adjoining the intersection of King and Duncan streets (1906-1907), and the Copp Clark Company&rsquo;s Wellington Street complex. The firm and its successors, Wickson, Gregg and Blackwell designed the subsequent additions to the latter site.The property at 517 Wellington Street West is associated historically with the publishing industry in Toronto and Canada as the location beginning in 1909 of the Copp Clark Company Limited. The origins of the firm dated to the 1840s when Scottish-born bookseller and publisher, Hugh Scobie opened a stationery store in Toronto that evolved into a printing and bookbinding enterprise. Following Scobie&rsquo;s death, part of his business was acquired by partners Thomas Maclear and George Elliott Thomas, whose employees included William Walter Copp (1826-1894). In 1869, Copp and Henry James Clark continued the enterprise as Copp, Clark and Company while suspending the retail operation. The &ldquo;Canadian Almanac&rdquo; founded by Scobie remained a cornerstone of Copp Clark&rsquo;s varied publications, which expanded in the late 19th century to include maps, school textbooks and popular literature. During the interwar era, controlling interest in Copp Clark was acquired by the descendants of George Elliott Thomas, who retained the company until 1955 when it was renamed the Copp Clark Publishing Company. In the 21st century specializing in products and services relating to global financial markets, Copp Clark remains Canada&rsquo;s longest continuously operating book publisher.
The Copp Clark Company Complex has associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which developed on part of the Military Reserve that was established in the 18th century west of the Town of York and was subsequently subdivided and sold in the early 19th century to accommodate the expansion of the City of Toronto. The plan of subdivision incorporated two important public squares (Victoria Memorial Square, with its military burial ground, and Clarence Square) that were connected by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place as the setting of upscale housing. Most of the original housing stock was removed as part of the transformation of the King-Spadina neighbourhood from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing centre after the Great Fire of 1904. The Copp Clark Company Complex was amongst the earliest industrial sites on Wellington Street West, west of Spadina Avenue, and contributed to the transformation of the formerly residential enclave.
Contextually, the property at 517 Wellington Street West supports the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s industrial centre. In King-Spadina, the Copp Clark Company Complex reflects the conversion in the early 20th century of the section of Wellington Street West originally known as Wellington Place from a residential enclave between Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square to part of Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector. As one of the earliest industrial developments on the street, the Copp Clark Company Complex is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on an expansive corner lot where it is viewed from Wellington, Portland and Front streets.

Watkiss, City Clerk",City Council,
236,Notice of Intention to Designate - 10-20 Widmer Street,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2018-09-11 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 10-20 Widmer Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation:
The properties at 10-20 Widmer Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description:
Located on the west side of the street, north of King Street West, the properties at 10-20 Widmer Street contain six 2&frac12;-storey house form buildings dating to 1876 whose construction is attributed to Toronto builder William A. Grant and his brothers.&nbsp; As the surviving six units of the original 10-part row, the Widmer Street Row Houses occupy land that was first developed for Toronto&rsquo;s inaugural general hospital and leased by the institution&rsquo;s trustees until the sale of the properties in the late 20th century.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:
The properties at 10-20 Widmer Street have cultural heritage value for their design as the oldest surviving group of row houses in the King-Spadina neighbourhood that are designed in the prototypical Toronto Bay-n-Gable style.&nbsp; The remaining six units of the original group of 10 buildings are distinguished by the elevated entrances, the bay windows that extend two stories from the raised bases to the first (ground) floor, and the original detailing that includes the brick corbels organizing the units into pairs, the pair of paneled wood doors on 10 Widmer, and the fish-scale shingles and wood detailing in the gable on 20 Widmer.
&nbsp;
The associative value of the properties at 10-20 Widmer Street is through their contribution to an understanding of the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where they are located on the lands originally developed for Toronto&rsquo;s first general hospital when the community was an institutional enclave (where the third Provincial Parliament Buildings were also situated) adjoined by residential subdivisions.&nbsp; The Widmer Street Row Houses were constructed following the relocation of York (Toronto) General Hospital, but prior to the transformation of King-Spadina as the city&rsquo;s new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; With the removal of most of the residential buildings that characterized the neighbourhood, the Widmer Street Row Houses survived to reflect the late-19th century appearance of this part of King-Spadina.
&nbsp;
Contextually, the properties at 10-20 Widmer Street contribute to the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it emerged in the 19th century as an institutional and residential enclave prior to its evolution as Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre.&nbsp; The Widmer Street Row Houses are historically, visually and physically related to their surroundings where they stand as the last remaining 19th century residential buildings on Widmer Street.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Widmer Street Row Houses at 10-20 Widmer Street are:
&nbsp;

The setback, placement and orientation of the row of six house form buildings on the west side of the street, north of King Street West
The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey buildings with the rectangular-shaped plans above the raised bases (the door openings in the bases are not original)
The gable roofs with the steeply-pitched gables on the east ends, with the surviving fish-scale shingles and wood detailing in the gable on 20 Widmer Street (the current bargeboard is not original), and the brick chimneys on the south elevation of 10 Widmer and the north elevation of 20 Widmer
The yellow brick cladding with the brick, stone and wood detailing
The arrangement of the six row houses into three pairs, which are organized as mirror images with the elevated entrances placed side by side, accessed by sets of stairs with wood detailing, and protected by open porches (the porches on the units at 18 and 20 Widmer Street have been removed)
On the east elevations, the segmental-arched door openings containing transoms and, on the building at 10 Widmer Street, the pair of paneled wood doors
The fenestration on the east elevation of each individual building, with the bay window that extends from the base to the first (ground) floor and contains large segmental-arched openings that are repeated in the second storey above the bay window and the entrance
The detailing on the east elevations, with the brick voussoirs and stone keystones on the door and window openings, the stone sills, and the corbelled brickwork along the roofline separating each pair of buildings
The rear (west) wings and additions are not identified as heritage attributes.

&nbsp;
Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2N2 within thirty days of September 11, 2018, which is October 11, 2018.

301,Notice of Intention to Designate - 35 Kingsway Crescent,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario, 35 Kingsway Crescent",2018-12-13 05:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 35 Kingsway Crescent under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 35 Kingsway Crescent, containing the building originally known as the Richard and Elsie Pearce house, in the Kingsway, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 35 Kingsway Crescent is located on the east side of Kingsway Crescent, and sits in a line of grand estate houses sharing a cohesive architectural character, scale and setting on the ridge overlooking the Humber River Valley in the Kingsway Park (now known as the Kingsway) neighbourhood established by Home Smith &amp; Co. The property contains the house originally known as the Richard and Elsie Pearce house designed and constructed in 1929 by the architects (R. S. Hanks) and builders of Home Smith &amp; Co. The two-and-a-half storey building was designed on an elongated cruciform plan with a steeply pitched hipped roof intersected by a lower gabled roof, punctuated by two tall chimneys. In 1946, Matthew James and Dorothy Boylen purchased the property and, in 1947, added the garage to the north in the same style as the house. In 1960, a semi-circular sunroom was added to the south end of the house. Two iron gates with stone gate posts provide access to the semi-circular drive which frames a deep lawn. Mature trees and shrubs contribute to the picturesque setting.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Pearce house at 35 Kingsway Crescent has design value as an exceptionally fine example of a Kingsway Park ""Old English Manor"" house type designed in concordance with the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement with Tudor Revival style elements. The characteristics of this type are evident in the grand scale combined with a contrasting informal picturesque character which is achieved through the massing with its steeply pitched roofs combining hipped and gable forms, the tall sculptural chimney, the projecting entrance bay with its gable roof jetty over a bay window and the recessed door of the principle entrance. The house displays a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit in the variety of form which is complimented by an equivalent mix of materials including Humber Valley River stone which is rough-hewn, the half timbering with stucco cladding of the second storey and the small paned casement wood windows. The informality of the Arts and Crafts principles is extended through the arrangement of the casement windows in a random pattern with a variety of sizes from one to three sections. The entry bay is given particular emphasis with a greater variety of materials, rough and smooth stone, half timbering with cross patterns as well as red-brick ""nogging,"" and leaded-glass windows with panes of stained glass. The location of the house on the Humber River Valley ridge, with its landscaped grounds, mature trees and broad lawn surrounded by a circular drive, adds to the characteristic picturesque quality of the property. Artistic merit is also evident in the care with which the two-car garage located to the north was designed with corresponding materials and Tudor Revival details to match the original house.
The Pearce house has historical value as it is associated with the early history and development of Kingsway Park, one of the suburban neighbourhood estates, including Baby Point, which were created through Robert Home Smith's Humber Valley Surveys. The 1914 surveys laid out as a sequence of neighbourhoods intended to preserve the natural landscape, contours and character of the area surrounding the Humber Valley River ravine, from the Queensway to Dundas Street West. Development of the individual lots was regulated by Home Smith &amp; Co., Robert's company of architects, builders and craftsmen, who would bring to life his vision of an arts and crafts community inspired by English garden suburb models and architecture with the motto ""a little bit of England away from England."" Smith's development was also grounded in the local context of the Humber River and the historic King's Mill, the first to be established on the Humber following the settlement of the Town of York in 1793. The Pearce house was designed and built by Robert S. Hanks, a leading architect at Home Smith &amp; Co.
The Pearce house is also valued for its historical association with the owners of the property, Richard Pearce (1892-1967) and Matthew James Boylen (1907-1970) who with his wife Dorothy owned the property from 1947 until his death. Both men had significant ties to mining in Canada and are inductees in the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame. Richard Pearce was the Editor and President of the Northern Miner which was founded in 1915 and run by Pearce and his brother Norman from 1916 through to the 1960s. The paper continues to be the primary source of news on Canada's mining industry and is globally regarded as the authority on Canadian mining. Matthew James Boylen began prospecting in 1922, from the 1930s owned numerous mines in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and then in the 1950s discovered and developed deposits of volcanogenic sulphide near Bathurst, New Brunswick which, according to the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame, was historically and economically significant as well as being scientifically important for providing new models for mineral exploration that have been adapted internationally.
Constructed in 1929 by Home Smith &amp; Co. in accordance with their design principles for the Humber Valley Survey suburbs and the Kingsway Park neighbourhood in particular, the house is physically, visually and historically linked to its surroundings. Situated on the east side of Kingsway Crescent, the Pearce house has contextual value as it maintains the early 20th century Arts and Crafts Garden Suburb character of Kingsway Park.
Located on the ridge overlooking the Humber River Valley to the east, the house is one in a series aligned on the ridge that share a similar grand manor house scale and Tudor Revival style elements. These houses on the east side are part of the larger collection of houses found throughout Kingsway Park that were designed in either an English cottage-manor house type or symmetrical Georgian style, constructed in a variety of sizes and typically featuring steeply pitched roofs, river stone, stucco, half-timbering or brick cladding with additional elements of craftsmanship evident in decorative details, stained and leaded glass, finely crafted wood door and window frames. The natural setting of the Kingsway, which is enhanced by the picturesque meandering street layout that follows the contours of the original terrain of the Humber River Valley, supported by the mature trees and landscaping of individual residential properties, is characteristic of the neighbourhood context.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Pearce house are:
1. The placement and orientation of the building on its property on the east side of Kingsway Crescent, north of Bloor Street West on a ridge overlooking the Humber River Valley
2. The setting of the house with the front lawn and semi-circular driveway
3. The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house with its cruciform plan, primary hipped roof and secondary cross-gable roof, prominent asymmetrical chimney mass which incorporates two windows capped by a shingled roof and projects beyond the front elevation
4. The cladding material which includes rough-hewn river stone at the first floor and on the chimneys, ashlar-finished stone around the primary entryway, red brick on the chimneys and in the ""nogging"" of the entry bay, half timbering on the main entry bay, stucco and half timbering with a pattern of diagonal bracing on the second floor level and the decorative diagonal patterning in the jettied central gable which is supported on decoratively carved wood brackets as well as the roof cladding which is cedar shingles on both the house and garage
5. The windows, which are arranged in an informal pattern in a range of sizes with corresponding bay widths and feature wood casements or leaded glass casements with stained glass elements
6. The primary entrance elements which include the ashlar-finished stone door frame with its stepped key-stones above the arched opening with its decorative mouldings, the wood door with its glazed openings and leaded glass
7. The garage with its steeply pitched gable roof, stone base and half timbering in the gable with a decorative square pattern featuring diamonds and the decorative bargeboard and gable pendant post, and pair of casement windows and pair of garage doors
8. The stepped and curved stone wall that connects the house to the garage

361,Proposed Amendments to the City of Toronto Municipal Code for Increases to the Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Certain Water and Wastewater Service Fees and the Introduction of a New Bulk Water Fee,,2019-01-28 05:00:00,"Notice is hereby given that City officials are recommending to Toronto City Council the enactment of a by-law, effective April 1, 2019, amending the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, and any other necessary Municipal Code Chapters as may be required, to:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees; and,
-&nbsp;&nbsp; to establish a new bulk water fee, based on the Block 1 Rate, for the supply and delivery of water at a City-owned and operated bulk water fill station.
As shown in Appendix A, available at: http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-123889.pdf, the recommended increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective April 1, 2019, are as follows:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate&nbsp; and the Block 2 Rate by 3.98%; and
-&nbsp;&nbsp; for flat rate consumers, all rates by 3.98%.
The proposed increases to water and wastewater service fees, as well as the recommended new bulk water fee, effective April 1, 2019, are shown in Appendix B, available at: http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-123890.pdf.
City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.
The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, as well as the proposed new bulk water fee, are set out in the report to the Budget Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer &amp; Treasurer and the Acting General Manager, Toronto Water entitled ""2019 Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees "" (the ""Report"").
The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2019 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.331 billion, which is fully funded from the 2019 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services. The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services. The recommended new bulk water fee reflects the cost of providing that service.
The Budget Committee has established two subcommittees to hear public deputations on the 2019 Capital and Operating Budgets. The Budget Subcommittee for City Hall, and North York Civic Centre Consultation and the Budget Subcommittee for Scarborough Civic Centre and Etobicoke Civic Centre Consultation will receive presentations from any person, or their counsel, agent or solicitor, who wishes to speak to the matter at one of the following meetings:

401,Notice of Intention to Designate - 901 Lawrence Avenue West (Columbus Centre) ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-02-14 05:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 901 Lawrence Avenue West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West (Columbus Centre) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the two categories of historical/associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West is located on the south side of Lawrence Avenue West, to the west of Dufferin Street and contains the Columbus Centre, which includes the three-storey St. Mary's Training School (1941), a one to three storey sports and recreational centre including a swimming pool (1962, 1968 and 1980), a double-storey entry atrium (1980) with the Joseph Carrier Art Gallery and the three-storey Rotunda (1980) through an agreement between the Italian Canadian Benevolent Corporation (ICBC) and the Government of Ontario. The complex is clad primarily in red brick with curtain wall-glazing on the 1978-80 addition and faces a large landscaped setting with a sculpture garden and tennis courts.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West has historic value for its association with the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, a religious order whose purpose was to provide refuge and education for young women who found themselves in perilous conditions or living as social outcasts.&nbsp; The Sisters purchased the property to build the St. Mary's Training School, which was occupied by the school from 1941 to 1973 and later adapted as part of the Columbus Centre complex.&nbsp; The property is also valued for its association with the ICBC (now known as Villa Charities) which through the dedicated, voluntary leadership of individual members undertook the fund-raising campaigns and building of retirement and community facilities for Italian Canadians from the late 1960s onward which culminated in 1980 with the completion of the Columbus Centre which has become a primary centre for Italian Canadian culture and heritage.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Located on the south side of Lawrence Avenue West at the heart of the former Sisters of the Good Shepherd property, the Columbus Centre has contextual value as it defines and maintains the character of the property as a hub of Italian community facilities.&nbsp; The rotunda which is the most visible architectural expression of the Columbus Centre sits within a sculpture garden with mature trees, pathways and tennis courts, surrounded on its borders by social and cultural institutions of the Italian community which include schools, retirement homes, long-term care, as well as the social, athletic, business, research and cultural facilities of the centre itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Columbus Centre is visually, physically, functionally and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp; As the physical and cultural focal point of the landscape as well as the neighbouring community, the rotunda is a landmark.
&nbsp;
The heritage attributes of the property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West are:
&nbsp;


The setback, placement and orientation of the Columbus Centre rotunda sitting within the landscaped setting of the sculpture garden which includes mature trees, and provision for sculptures and a pathway which connects with the Villa Colombo


The scale, circular form and massing of the three storey rotunda designed as a large gathering space


The mosaic-tiled and brick door frame at the east corner of the south elevation of the St. Mary's Training School with the words ""St. Mary's Training School"" and decorative mosaic patterns


Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Francine Adamo, Administrator, North York Community Council, North York Civic Centre, Main Floor, 5100 Yonge Street, Toronto, Ontario M2N 5V7, within thirty days of February 14, 2019, which is March 18, 2019.

Canada Biscuit Company Building
Reasons for Designation
The property at 663 King Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description:
Located on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 663 King Street West contains a four-storey industrial building that was constructed in 1900 for the Canada Biscuit Company according to the designs of Toronto architect A. R. (Arthur Richard) Denison.&nbsp; Following the demise of the latter company in 1905, the complex was acquired by a trio of manufacturers&rsquo; agents who headed the Anglo-Canadian Leather Company, which became the lead tenant in the building.&nbsp; A significant occupant between 1907 and 1921 was the Reliance Knitting Company, which eventually purchased the property following its amalgamation with another manufacturer.&nbsp; The Samuel Trees Company, a saddlery manufacturer that evolved its business to produce automobile fittings, owned and occupied the building for nearly 40 years, a period when the Bank of Montreal operated a branch on the premises.
The property at 663 King Street West was listed on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Inventory) in 1973.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 663 King Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:
The property at 663 King Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of an early-20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sheer scale of the building is viewed on Bathurst Street where the west elevation extends 14 bays to Stewart Street, and the principal (north) elevation on King Street is distinguished by the stone facing of the lower wall and the organization of the windows above in a three-storey arcade.
The cultural heritage value of 663 King Street West is also through its contribution to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Biscuit Company Building anchors a major intersection in King-Spadina where it is an integral part of the collection of industrial buildings that extends along King Street West.
The Canada Biscuit Company Building is also valued for its historical association with Toronto architect A. R. (Arthur Richard) Denison.&nbsp; A member of one of the city&rsquo;s founding families, Denison accepted innumerable commissions during a career that lasted more than 40 years and included brief partnerships with other practitioners.&nbsp; During the period in the early 1900s when he designed the Canada Biscuit Company Building, Denison specialized in factories and warehouses, including the E. W. Gillett Company&rsquo;s complex (1912) on Fraser Street in today&rsquo;s Liberty Village, which is also recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Contextually, the value of the property at 663 King Street West is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Biscuit Company Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting at King Street West and Bathurst Street where it anchors a major intersection in both King-Spadina and Toronto with the landmark Wheat Sheaf Tavern (1849) on the opposite (southwest) corner.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Canada Biscuit Company Building at 663 King Street West are:
&middot;The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork along the north, west and south elevations
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation on King Street West with the stone cladding in the first storey where the main entrance is centered between two oversized flat-headed window openings and, in the upper three stories, brick arcades organize the pairs of flat-headed window openings with the continuous stone lintels and sills
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extended west elevation on Bathurst Street, with the organization and detailing of the flat-headed door and window openings, some of which have been altered
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the west elevation, the cornice between the third and fourth stories in the southerly seven bays, which marks the point where the complementary extra storey was added
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation on Stewart Street extending five bays, which has an entrance in the first (ground) floor and pairs of flat-headed window openings above, and where the cornice between the third and fourth stories is continued from the west elevation
No heritage attributes are identified on the east elevation.&nbsp; The adjoining four-storey building at 60 Stewart Street is not identified in the Statement of Significance (Reasons for Designation).

The property at 64 Wellesley Street East is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description:
Located on the north side of the street between Yonge Street (west) and Church Street (east), the property at 64 Wellesley Street East contains the Wellesley Apartments, a five-storey apartment building completed in 1931 according to the designs of Toronto architect J. E. H. Paisley.&nbsp; The site was identified as having cultural heritage interest in the North Downtown Yonge Street Urban Design Guidelines adopted by City Council in 2013.
Statement of Significance:
The property at 64 Wellesley Street East is valued for its design as a well-crafted apartment building from the interwar era with features of the Georgian Revival style popularized for residential architecture.&nbsp; Its design is distinguished by the classical detailing on the main (south) entrance surround, which is a hallmark of the style, as well as the stair-hall window above with its scrollwork and metal balustrade, and the parapet along the south roofline with the stone-framed openings and triangular-shaped pediment.
The associative value of the Wellesley Apartments is through the connection of the building to Toronto architect J. E. H. (James Edward Harris) Paisley who designed the complex.&nbsp; Paisley was affiliated with the Toronto Board of Education and local practitioner Ferdinand H. Marani before he established a solo office in the 1920s.&nbsp; While his career was hindered by the Great Depression of the 1930s, he received recognition through his designs for a small collection of apartment houses for Grover C. Murdoch, including 64 Wellesley Street East, as part of his surviving portfolio in Toronto.
Contextually, the property at 64 Wellesley Street East has cultural heritage value through its historical, visual and physical links to its setting beside the Paul Kane House (1853, with later additions), a local landmark in Toronto, and its proximity to Church Street in the centre of the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood.
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the Wellesley Apartments at 64 Wellesley Street East are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street between Yonge Street (west) and Church Street (east) and beside (east of) the Paul Kane House
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey I-shaped plan, which is organized with the main body (south) and the wing (north)
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone, wood and metal detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the parapet at the south end, which has stone-framed openings, stone coping and a triangular-shaped stone pediment in the centre
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (south) elevation, the organization of the wall into five bays with the central entrance in the first (ground) floor
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main (south) entrance, which is placed in a stone surround with classical detailing that includes an entablature, mouldings and brackets

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone band courses on the base and above the first- and fifth-floor openings on the south elevation, which extend across the south ends of the east and west side walls of the main body
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west elevations of the main body of the building, which continue the pattern and detailing of the flat-headed openings from the south elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north wing of the building, which is set back from the main body on the east and west sides and extended at the north end to complete the &ldquo;I&rdquo; shape
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north wing, the brick band courses and the symmetrically-placed flat-headed door and window openings with the brick and stone detailing.

495,Notice of Intention to Designate - 15 Duncan Street and 158 Pearl Street,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-03-19 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 15 Duncan Street and 158 Pearl Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
15 DUNCAN STREET&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 15 Duncan Street is worthy of&nbsp; designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act or its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 15 Duncan Street is located on the northeast corner of Pearl Street, and contains a three-storey factory building that was constructed in 1903 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Company commissioned the building, which it occupied for over half a century.
The property at 15 Duncan Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 15 Duncan Street as a contributing heritage property.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 15 Duncan Street has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp; The design is distinguished by its symmetry and the classical embellishments that are identified with the style, and particularly by the arcades of round arches on the principal (west) and the south elevations on Duncan and Pearl streets, respectively.
The cultural heritage value of 15 Duncan is also through its half-century association with the Canada Printing Ink Company, which was internationally recognized for its development of inks for newspapers, magazines and other print media.&nbsp; In its manufacturing complex in King-Spadina, the company produced specialty inks and developed new technologies, which included the Maxichrom System (the forerunner to the Mix-and-Match System of the 1970s) where any colour could be matched using 12 basic inks.
The Canada Printing Ink Building is valued for its contributions to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Building was one of the first buildings completed on the former Upper Canada College lands following the redevelopment of the campus for industrial uses.
The historical value of the property at 15 Duncan Street is also through its connection with the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg, which designed the Canada Printing Ink Building prior to the dissolution of the partnership.&nbsp; While W. R. (William Rufus) Gregg and his younger brother, A. R. (Alfred Holden) Gregg led successful architectural practices alone and with other architects, during the period from 1893 to 1904 when they worked together the pair is credited with several factories in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, including the Eclipse Whitewear Building (1903) at King Street West and John Street, the White Swan Mills Building at 158 Pearl Street, and the subject building.
Contextually, the value of the property at 15 Duncan Street is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it is part of an important collection of former factories and warehouses that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto's manufacturing centre after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Building is historically and visually linked to its setting where, with the adjoining White Swan Mills Building (1903) at 158 Pearl Street and the Southam Press Building (1908) at 19 Duncan Street, it is part of the surviving trio of early 20th century industrial buildings that anchor the northeast corner of Duncan and Pearl streets, south of Adelaide Street West.

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classical arrangement of the principal (west) and south elevations, with the base, the two-storey arcades and, above the stone cornice, the attic
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration, with the segmental-arched openings in the base, first and third stories (as well as the pair of diminutive openings above the west entrance), the round-arched openings in the second storey, and the brick and stone trim
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The west entrance, which is placed in the fifth bay from the south end and has been altered

158 PEARL STREET
Reasons for Designation
The property at 158 Pearl Street (which includes the address at 154 Pearl Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 158 Pearl Street is located on the north side of the street, east of Duncan Street, and contains a three-storey factory building that was constructed in 1903 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg.&nbsp; The original occupant, White Swan Mills, producers of flour, cereals and spices, remained in this location for 25 years, followed by the stationery department of the Canadian Bank of Commerce (forerunner to today's Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC) for over 30 years.

Steele Briggs Building:
Reasons for Designation
The property at 49 Spadina Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 49 Spadina Avenue is located on the northeast corner of Front Street West south of Clarence Square in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and contains a five-storey factory building that was constructed in 1911 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Sproatt and Rolph.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Seed Company commissioned the building, which it occupied it for over half a century.
The property at 49 Spadina Avenue was included on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in June 1973.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 49 Spadina Avenue as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 49 Spadina Avenue has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp; The design of the Steele Briggs Building is particularly distinguished by the application of different yet complementary classical detailing on the south, west and north elevations that face Front Street West, Spadina Avenue and Clarence Square, respectively, including the repetition of the round arch motif.
The cultural heritage value of 49 Spadina Avenue is also through its contribution to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Building replaced earlier house form buildings that outlined the south edge of Clarence Square and anchored the south end of the collection of industrial buildings extending north along Spadina Avenue from Front Street West.
The Steele Briggs Building is also valued for its historical association with the Toronto architects Sproatt and Rolph.&nbsp; Headed by Henry Sproatt and Ernest Rolph, the partnership became amongst the leading architectural firms in Canada and is credited with introducing the influential Neo-Gothic as a national style with the commission for Hart House at the University of Toronto.&nbsp; Often working in association with other celebrated Canadian architects, Sproatt and Rolph produced many of Toronto&rsquo;s most notable buildings, including the Royal York Hotel (1929) and Canada Life's 1931 headquarters on University Avenue.&nbsp; Sproatt and Rolph designed several factories and warehouses in King-Spadina, with the Steele Briggs Building remaining the most visually prominent with its setting overlooking Clarence Square.
Contextually, the value of the property at 49 Spadina Avenue is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting at Front Street West and Spadina Avenue where it anchors this major intersection, overlooks the adjoining Clarence Square and forms the south edge of the industrial buildings that line Spadina Avenue and include the Gale Building (1904) at 24 Spadina and the Systems Building (1907) at 46 Spadina, which are recognized heritage properties on the opposite side of the street.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Steele Briggs Building at 49 Spadina Avenue are:
-&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the northeast corner of Front Street West and Spadina Avenue, south of Clarence Square
-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey building above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings
-&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing
-&nbsp; The flat roofline with the brick parapets
-&nbsp; The south, west and north elevations where the brick piers with the stone detailing organize the flat-headed door and window openings with the stone lintels and sills and the round-arched door openings with the brick voussoirs and stone keystones, including those originally designed for cargo doors
-&nbsp; On the south elevation facing Front Street West, the round-arched door and window openings in each storey of the central bay
-&nbsp; The west elevation on Spadina Avenue where four-storey frontispieces surmounted by cornices contain round-arched arcades of windows

561,Notice of Intention to Designate - 226 St. George Street,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-04-02 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 226 St. George Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 226 St. George Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the west side of St. George Street south of Bernard Avenue in The Annex neighbourhood, the George Gooderham Mitchell House (1903) is a 2.5-storey brick and stone house form building designed by the architect David Roberts Jr. for George Gooderham Mitchell and subsequently used as a vocational school by various groups affiliated with the Roman Catholic faith. The property was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in July 1976.
Statement of Significance
The property at 226 St. George Street has cultural heritage value as a fine representative example of Queen Anne Revival styling applied to a large house form building in the first decade of the twentieth century. The style, identified by the variety of materials and decorative detailing, asymmetrical profile and complicated roof lines, represented the exuberant architecture of the late Victorian era. The George Gooderham Mitchell House is noteworthy for its attractive combination of forms, massing and stonework.
The George Gooderham Mitchell House is valued for its associations with a member of Toronto's prominent Gooderham family, which co-founded the famed Gooderham and Worts Distillery (now the Distillery District).&nbsp; The property was developed and initially occupied by stockbroker George Gooderham Mitchell, grandson of George Gooderham.
The property at 226 St. George Street is also valued for its association with the architect David Roberts, Jr., who had extensive connections to the Gooderham family.&nbsp; Roberts oversaw much of the work at the Gooderham and Worts Distillery (including the reconstruction of several buildings after the 1870 fire) and designed the landmark Gooderham Building at Wellington and Front Streets (completed in 1892 and known locally as the ""Flat-Iron Building"").&nbsp; He also prepared plans for the residences of various Gooderham family members, with the grand George Gooderham House (dating to 1889-91 and currently the York Club) at the northeast corner of St. George and Bloor Streets being among his best known commissions.
Contextually, the property at 226 St. George Street has cultural heritage value for its visual and historical links to its setting in The Annex neighbourhood.&nbsp; Its appearance reflects the late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century development of the area as one of the most sought-after residential enclaves in Toronto where the city's leading citizens occupied large-scale houses.&nbsp; The George Gooderham Mitchell House is significant in context with the three additional large Edwardian homes directly to the north, and other surviving house form buildings along St. George Street that were originally owned by members of the Gooderham family and/or designed by prominent Toronto architects and recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the George Gooderham Mitchell House at 226 St. George Street are:
-&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the west side of St. George Street south of Bernard Avenue
-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2.5-storey plan above a raised basement
-&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the stone and wood detailing
-&nbsp; The combination of hipped and gabled roofs including the oversized gable on the principal (east) elevation with its two symmetrically-arranged openings with double-hung sash windows, the gabled dormer windows and the brick chimneys, all on the north and south slopes
-&nbsp; The deep profile of the eaves at the roofline on the principal (east) and north elevations and corner tower with the wood soffits, moulded fascia and decorative brackets&nbsp;
-&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation, which is organized into three bays plus 2.5-storey corner tower at the south end, a 2-storey bay window in the north bay and the centrally-positioned main entrance
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The main entry located on the principal (east) elevation, which is elevated and protected by a flat-roofed porch with banded stone detailing on the columns and surmounted by a brick parapet
-&nbsp; &nbsp;At the southeast corner, the 2.5-storey octagonal corner tower with its conical roof topped with a decorative metal finial
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the south side, the single-storey, rectangular, projecting bay with its arched parapet roofline and rectangular end walls
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the east, north and south sides, the fenestration with the stone detailing that incorporates broad flat-headed openings, double-hung sash windows, and a single fixed pane window in the central opening of the first-floor bay window at the north end of the principal (east) elevation
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the north and south sides, the round-arched openings and their round-arched stone headers in the gabled dormers
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The decorative glass transom above each window opening at the first-floor level on the principal (east) elevation including on the corner tower
Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 2, 2019, which is May 2, 2019.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 721 Eastern Avenue, containing the complex of industrial buildings originally known as the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. and, from 1929 until 2004, as The Canada Metal Company Ltd., is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
The property at 721 Eastern Avenue is located in Leslieville, on the south side of Eastern Avenue between Carlaw Avenue and Leslie Street, north of Lakeshore Boulevard and the former Gardiner Expressway which for 80 years contained the former industrial complex known as The Canada Metal Company Ltd. The first building constructed on the site in 1925-6 by the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. was the Main Building (including Buildings A+B), located at the northwest corner of the property and built to the design of Wells &amp; Gray Ltd., Engineers and Contractors.&nbsp; Building A included upper level offices and a shipping warehouse below and Building B contained the factory.&nbsp; From 1929 until 1980 the complex would undergo a continuous series of expansions, alterations and demolitions, primarily to the designs of Wells &amp; Gray, in response to an evolving sequence of functions related to the production of metal alloys, until operations ceased.&nbsp; One of these structures was the building known as Building G (1943) connecting the Main Building and Foundry Building (D, 1929). The proximity to the CNR railway to the south of the property meant that railway spurs were included in the property's evolution.&nbsp; In 1930 Hoyt amalgamated with other metal companies and became known as The Canada Metal Co. Ltd which continued to own the property until 2004.&nbsp; After that time the large industrial spaces accommodated Cinespace Film Studios until General Motors of Canada purchased the property in 2016.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Canada Metal Company Ltd. property, including the original Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. Main Building, the office and warehouse building (Building A), located at the property at 721 Eastern Avenue, is a fine representative of the industrial building type which emerged in the 19th century and whose key characteristic was a plan based on a structural grid of columns providing maximum internal flexibility for the accommodation of factory machinery and the production and movement of products.&nbsp; The structural grid is reflected on the building's principal (north) and side (west) elevations with their regular composition of brick piers flanking banks of windows.&nbsp; The embellishment of the building's elevations, the sculptural relief of the brick wall surface between piers and stepped brick bands over the second-floor windows, the classical styling of the entrance with its brick piers, precast stone bases and entablature incised with the word ""OFFICE,"" and the decorative panels above the entrance marked by precast stone squares, are typical of the early 20th century industrial buildings which frequently retained elements of the Classical style.
Building G, the connecting link between the Main Building (A + B) and the Foundry Building (D), is valued for its design which, in the light-weight appearance of its structural steel framing and the clerestory roof, constructed to maximize daylight for factory workers, is expressive of a functionally elegant 20th-century industrial building typology.
The property is valued for its association with the international Hoyt Metal Company, an important manufacturer and innovator of metal alloys in the early 20th century, which was based in the United Kingdom with branches in Australia, the U.S. A. and Canada. The Toronto branch was established in 1909 and managed by George F. Allen, an American inventor and patent-holder for inventions related to metal alloys.&nbsp; The property is also associated with the Canada Metal Company Ltd.&nbsp; In 1929, the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada merged with the Toronto-based Canada Metal Company Ltd. a nation-wide employer and manufacturer of metal alloy products, which started in the 1890s by William G. Harris in the backyard of his home on St. Patrick Street. The Canada Metal Co. continued to operate at the Eastern Avenue property from 1929 until 2004 and was an important employer in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The property has historic value for the information it yields regarding the growth of industry and how it contributed to the development of the working class neighbourhood between World Wars I and II.&nbsp; The building is also valued as it demonstrates the work of the firm of Wells &amp; Gray Ltd. Engineers and Contractors, who were well-known for their infrastructure projects in Ontario, extending from bridges to railway stations, their expertise in concrete construction, their leadership in the design of well-lit factories and their architectural design skills.
Contextually, the building is valued as it maintains and supports the early industrial character of the neighbourhood south of Leslieville on Eastern Avenue. With its carefully crafted elevations, Main Building (A) contributes to the sequence of finely designed, early to mid-twentieth century industrial buildings situated along Eastern Avenue.&nbsp; Located with on the south side of Eastern Avenue since 1925, Building A is historically, visually and functionally linked to the residential neighbourhoods as well as the original industrial buildings and their subsequent adaptive re-use by the film industry.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Hoyt Metal Co. Main Building (Building A) are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the south side of Eastern Avenue west of Leslie Street&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey industrial warehouse-type building with a rectangular plan and flat roof
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the elevations (now visible on the north and west sides) as a series of bays of equal width, demarcated by brick piers with windows in the bays between the piers
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which includes brick, with brick piers and decorative stepped details above the second floor windows, and precast stone, which is featured in the&nbsp; entablature with the word ""OFFICE"" carved on its frieze, the precast stone capitals and bases of the piers flanking the entrance facing Eastern Avenue, the decorative pattern of precast stone blocks on the brick wall above the entrance and the concrete base which wraps around the building with protruding bases for the brick piers
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows, which include steel factory sash at the ground floor and double-paned wood sash at the upper storey on the principle (north) and side (west) elevations and glass block on the upper floor of the east-side elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the interior, the steel columns supported by concrete bases
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A connecting building between the Hoyt Company Main Building (A + B) and the Foundry Building, (G) with its steel structure, including the columns, roof trusses and clerestory windows

363-365 Yonge Street - Richard S. Williams Block
Reasons for Designation
The property at 363-365 Yonge Street (Richard S. Williams Block) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould and Gerrard Streets, the Richard S. Williams Block (1890) is a four-storey commercial building. The property was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1974.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Richard S. Williams Block has design value as a fine representative and rare example in Toronto of a late-nineteenth century Victorian commercial building eclectically designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style with Moorish Revival details. The composition and detailing of the principal (west) elevation on Yonge Street, with its rusticated stone and red brick cladding combined with horseshoe arches, key and diaper patterns and decorative terracotta, display a high degree of artistic merit. In recognition of its architectural significance, the building was amongst some of the earliest included on the City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in March 1974.&nbsp;
The Richard S. Williams Block has historic value for its association with the architects, A. R. Denison and G. W. King. Concurrent with construction of the Richard S. Williams Block, the design partnership of Denison &amp; King produced two other known similarly eclectic Victorian buildings in the city that, together, represent a rare collection blending eastern design influences with contemporary western revival architectural styles. These include the Comstock Building at Victoria and Lombard Streets and the Athenaeum Club on Church Street, both of which are designated properties under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Situated on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East, the Richard S. Williams Block has contextual value as it supports and maintains the late-nineteenth century commercial building character that defines much of the historic built form of downtown Yonge Street as it developed as Toronto's 'main street'.&nbsp; As one of a number of heritage properties on both sides of this block of Yonge Street, the Richard S. Williams Block is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Richard S. Williams Block are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey commercial building built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its red brick, stone and terracotta cladding
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressed metal cornice with its dentilled detailing at the roofline on the principal (west) elevation

367 Yonge Street - Reasons for Designation
The property at 367 Yonge Street is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 367 Yonge Street contains a three-storey building with retail at the ground floor and residential above. The building was constructed by 1869 of solid brick construction with brick cladding (currently covered with stucco on the west elevation).&nbsp; The property is located on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 367 Yonge Street has design value as a representative example of a mid-nineteenth century commercial and residential building that blends elements of the Georgian and Greek Revival styles. The principal (west) elevation's symmetrically-arranged, flat-headed openings with their segmental-arched headers surmounted by scroll corbels and stone sills below are further enlivened by a corbelled brick Greek key pattern frieze below the decorative wood-bracketed roofline.
The building has historic value as it is associated with the earliest development of this portion of Yonge Street in the mid-nineteenth century. Along with the two attached buildings directly north of the subject property, this three-storey group represents the tallest and earliest solid brick construction on this block of Yonge Street that otherwise contained only one or two-storey wood frame buildings before 1870.
Situated on the east side of Yonge Street, between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East and directly adjacent to the Richard S. Williams Block at 363-365 Yonge Street, the property at 367 Yonge Street has contextual value as it maintains the low-rise commercial and residential building character that defined the historic built form of the area in the second half of the nineteenth century. It is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 367 Yonge Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey commercial and residential building built on a rectangular plan with a pitched roof and brick chimney with its corbelled brick crown at the north end
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its buff brick, stone and wood cladding
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracketed wood fascia and soffit at the roofline and decorative corbelled brick frieze directly below
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The symmetrical arrangement of flat-headed openings on the second and third floors of the principal (west) elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone detailing including the window sills and segmental-arched headers above the second and third floor openings with their scroll-shaped corbel brackets
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the pattern of divisions of windows with a transom light in the first floor window, and for the second and third floor windows, as shown in the original architect's drawings, the double-hung sash featuring two lights over one
Note: the stucco currently covering the brick cladding on the principal (west) elevation is not considered a heritage attribute
381 Yonge Street - Yonge Street Mission Building
Reasons for Designation
The property at 381 Yonge Street (Yonge Street Mission Building) is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 381 Yonge Street contains the Yonge Street Mission, an institutional building located on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East. Originally constructed in 1904, the Yonge Street Mission is a two-storey structure with a pitched roof including five skylights along the ridgeline. The principal (west) elevation was completely rebuilt to the designs of Mathers &amp; Haldenby, architects, in 1953.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Yonge Street Mission Building has design value as a fine representative of a low-rise, mid-twentieth century institutional building whose Stripped Classicism is indicative of the work of the prominent Toronto architectural firm, Mathers &amp; Haldenby. The style defines a transitional moment in Toronto architecture immediately following WWII that was expressed as a blending of Neo-Classicism and Modernism. At the Yonge Street Mission Building, traditional limestone cladding and details maintain a classical monumentality on the principal (west) elevation while the strong verticality of the openings and their minimalist detailing harken toward Modernist curtain wall construction and its associated aesthetic.
The property at 381 Yonge Street has historic value for its association with the history of the Yonge Street Mission founded in 1896 and the organization's operation at the subject location since 1904 (then owned by the Hon. Samuel Hume Blake), providing charitable services and social programs to vulnerable residents in Toronto. Since 1979, the Mission's Evergreen Centre has focused these efforts on the needs of street youth.
The current building is valued for its association with the architectural firm of Mathers &amp; Haldenby, who designed many prominent mid-century structures across the city including the iconic Imperial Oil Building at 111 St. Clair Avenue West, which is recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Situated on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East and abutting the corner property at 385-391 Yonge Street, the Yonge Street Mission has contextual value as it maintains the low-rise building character that defined the historic built form of the area from the mid-nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century.
The Yonge Street Mission is also valued as a long-time local landmark institution on Yonge Street, south of Gerrard. This charitable organization has provided assistance to Toronto's most vulnerable residents since its founding in 1896 and has operated continuously from 381 Yonge Street since 1904. The Yonge Street Mission is an important institution in the social history of the city that has been physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings for the past 115 years.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Yonge Street Mission Building are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey building with its flat roof behind a gabled parapet on the principal (west) elevation and pitched roof with five skylights over the auditorium (which are part of the Yonge Street Mission building's earlier 1904 design by the architectural firm, G. M. Miller &amp; Co. and appear in the original architectural drawings).
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its Indiana limestone cladding
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracketed wood soffit at the roofline on the principal (west) elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrangement of the fenestration on the upper floor of the principal (west) elevation with the three evenly-spaced rectangular openings with stone headers, surrounds and profiled mullions in a three-over-three-over-three pattern centrally and two-over-two-over-two near the north and south ends
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The carvings in their centred position in the limestone entablature on the principal (west) elevation including the lighthouse emblem, architectural lettering reading ""Yonge Street Mission"" and two equal-sided crosses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
385-391 Yonge Street (including 3 Gerrard Street East) - Gerrard Building
Reasons for Designation
The Gerrard Building is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East, the Gerrard Building (1924) is a three-storey commercial and office building.&nbsp; The property was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1990.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Gerrard Building has design value as a fine representative, and rare example along Yonge Street, of the Modern Gothic style adapted to a commercial building. It is distinguished by its contemporary updating of a historical style with its sleek sandstone cladding and tripartite division of window openings in a variation of the Chicago Style along with stylized octagonal piers and wall buttresses.
The Gerrard Building has historic value for its association with the prolific architects, Sproatt &amp; Rolph, and is recognized amongst the numerous fine commercial buildings the firm designed in Toronto during the early-twentieth century including the Royal York Hotel on Front Street. The site is also associated with The Forum, a grand High Victorian commercial block that formerly anchored this corner and contributes to an understanding of the evolution of the intersection at Yonge and Gerrard Streets.
Situated prominently on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East the Gerrard Building has contextual value as it anchors and maintains the low-rise commercial building character that defined the historic built form of the area from the mid-nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. With its position on a corner lot and grand presence, the Gerrard Building stands as a reminder of the grandeur of Yonge Street as it developed in the early twentieth century.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Gerrard Building are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey commercial and office building built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Yonge Street (west) and Gerrard Street East (north) elevations, the sandstone cladding with stone trim
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Yonge Street (west) elevation, the location and stone detailing of the entry at the south end of the building
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the flat-headed openings and their detailing on the Yonge Street (west) and Gerrard Street East (north) elevations, which are divided vertically into four bays and six bays, respectively
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrangement of the fenestration in the upper floors on the west and north elevations including its tripartite division by secondary piers, and with the central opening containing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above each window pane on the second and third floors of the west and north elevations, the transom lights (currently opaque spandrels) with their four-over-four arrangement (as seen in the original architectural drawings and 1950 archival photographs)
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west and north elevations, the stone detailing including the octagonal piers with their faux compound piers and pointed finials at the first floor, and the decorative carved stone band surmounted by a continuous stone cornice directly above the third floor openings.3.

","In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-04-08 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 58 Wheatfield Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation:
The property at 58 Wheatfield Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description:
Located in the area northeast of Lake Shore Boulevard West and Royal York Road in Mimico, the property at 58 Wheatfield Road contains a 2&frac12;-storey house form building (1908) designed in the Period Revival style with Arts and Crafts features that is attributed to Toronto architect Alfred Baker, who occupied the residence for nearly half a century.&nbsp; The property was listed on the former City of Etobicoke Heritage Inventory prior to 1998, and its inclusion on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) was confirmed in 2006.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:
The property at 58 Wheatfield Road is valued for its design as an early 20th century house form building in the Period Revival style with features inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, including the expansive L-shaped plan, the cladding, the extended roofline and detailing, the square bay window and, in some of the openings, the multi-paned windows.&nbsp; Its design is attributed to architect Alfred Baker, the first owner and occupant of the property, who served as the chief draftsman and assistant to the notable architect S. Hamilton Townsend when the latter firm completed high-end residential projects in Rosedale.
The associative value of the Alfred Baker House is through its contribution to the residential development of Mimico in the early 20th century.&nbsp; While Mimico originated as a late-18th century milling and farming community accessed by road and water, the area remained isolated until the arrival of the steam railway and the layout of a model town in the mid-1800s.&nbsp; The introduction of a radial railway at the end of the 19th century improved connections with Toronto and promoted Mimico's steady development after 1900 as a police village, village and town.&nbsp; During this era, former farmland was developed for both waterfront estates and residential subdivisions, the latter providing housing for workers in both Mimico and neighbouring New Toronto, as well as commuters to the city, including architect Alfred Baker.&nbsp;
Contextually, the property at 58 Wheatfield Road has cultural heritage value through its support for the character of the neighbourhood northeast of Lake Shore Avenue West and Royal York Road where the collection of residential, ecclesiastical and educational buildings forms the historic core of the Mimico.&nbsp; The Alfred Baker House is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Wheatfield Road where, with its vintage and appearance, it represents the initial development of the street after the turn of the 20th century.
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the Alfred Baker House at 58 Wheatfield Road are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the west side of the street, south of Hillside Avenue.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey L-shaped plan, with the main body extending north and south and the short wing facing east toward Wheatfield Road.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross-gable roof with the extended eaves and the purlins on the wing facing the street.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the stucco cladding and the wood and stone detailing.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation where, on the wing, the main entrance is placed in a moulded surround, protected by a wood canopy with pilasters and brackets, and flanked on the right (north) by a segmental-arched window opening.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation of the main body, the single-storey four-part square bay window in the first (ground) floor.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining fenestration, with the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings on the east, north and south elevations of the main body and wing.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation, the multi-paned windows in the openings in the second storey of the wing.

588,Notice of Intention to Designate - 280 Jarvis Street and 288-290 Jarvis Street ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-04-16 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 280 Jarvis Street and 288-290 Jarvis Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
280 Jarvis Street:
Reasons for Designation
The property at 280 Jarvis Street, containing a semi-detached house-form building, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located north of Gerrard Street East on the west side of Jarvis Street in the Garden District, the property at 280 Jarvis Street (originally known as 280-282 Jarvis Street) contains a pair of two-and-a-half storey, semi-detached houses, designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque Style and built as one of three pairs, extending from 280-290 Jarvis Street, by William Carlyle in 1890.&nbsp; In 1955 the semis at 280-282 Jarvis Street were converted to a lodging house and in 1972 were united as a single unit for office use at which time the property became known as 280 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; The design of the principal elevation of this pair of semis is mirrored by the other pair constructed at 288-290 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; In 1966, the pair at 284-286 Jarvis Street was demolished and their design as the centrepiece of the composition of the three buildings remains unknown. In 1973, City Council adopted a recommendation to include the property on the City's first Heritage Inventory.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
William Carlyle's pair of semi-detached houses at 280 Jarvis Street is an excellent example of the Richardsonian Romanesque.&nbsp; The style is evident in the picturesque massing of the principal, east elevation with its canted south-east corner rising as a turret, the broad archway framing recessed entries, the bay window at the second storey and the roofscape, with its octagonal, pyramid roof, dormers and two chimneys.&nbsp; The materials, sandstone, brick and terracotta, which is used in the shingles with scalloped or diamond-shaped tiles, decoratively-molded string courses and roof-top finials, are all quintessential Richardsonian Romanesque features. A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the way the elevations of the pair is treated as a united whole so that each semi has different features rather than the predictable symmetry with identical doors and windows.&nbsp; Further, 280 and 288-290 Jarvis Street were constructed as mirror images of one another so that their prominent towers would anchor the outer corners of the whole assembly of the three pairs of semi-detached houses, creating a handsome group on Jarvis Street.
The houses have historical value for their association with their builder, William Carlyle (1820-1903) a Scottish immigrant and successful contractor who was elected Alderman for St. Thomas's Ward (1879-1890), served as Chairman of the Board of Works for the City of Toronto and was appointed Justice of the Peace for Toronto in 1884.&nbsp;
The properties have associative value as they contribute to an understanding of the historical development of Jarvis Street, representing the period of the street when it evolved as an attractive, late 19th-century avenue of broad, tree-lined boulevards faced with civic and religious institutions, grand estate homes and a range of more modest housing types.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Contextually, the Carlyle houses are important for maintaining and supporting the late 19th-century character of Jarvis Street as well as contributing to the diversity of periods which the street presents as a record of its evolution.&nbsp; Located in the Garden District on the west side of the street on the block between Gerrard and Carlton streets, the two pairs of semi-detached houses maintain the setback and landscaped setting typical of 19th-century residential properties on Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Across the street, on the east side, are 19th-century buildings and a public space including the Jarvis Street Baptist Church (1875), the former Samuel Platt House (1849-50), Allan Gardens (1860) and St. Andrews Church (1878).&nbsp; To the north of the Carlyle houses, at 300 Jarvis Street, is the 1930 Art Deco Frontenac Arms hotel (now the Ramada Inn).&nbsp; To the south, at the intersection of Jarvis and Gerrard, is the Spanish-Revival Crown Hotel (now the Econo Lodge) at 335 Jarvis Street, and the Mid-century Modern, Juvenile and Family Courts Building at 311 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; These buildings and public spaces are just a small selection of the significantly rich collection of Toronto architecture and public amenities representing diverse periods, typologies and styles that characterise Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Constructed in 1890, the two pairs of semi-detached houses are physically, visually and historically linked to their surroundings, contributing to the architectural diversity of this historically important Toronto thoroughfare.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Carlyle houses at 280 Jarvis Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the west side of Jarvis, north of Gerrard Street East in the Garden District
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting of the house with the landscaped area in front of the house including the mature trees
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house with its rectangular plan with a canted, south-east corner rising as a turret, the east-facing sloped roof with an octagonal pyramid roof and two dormers, recessed entrance under a broad arch with its canted walls, rear, two-storey flat-roofed wing and two chimneys near the front, east elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which includes rusticated sandstone of two types, red brick and terracotta shingles in scalloped and diamond shapes
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows openings including the ground floor openings of various rectangular sizes, the second floor bay window with its wood mouldings and panels, the&nbsp; pair of windows in the turret, single window on the canted corner and pair of smaller windows on the centre of the elevation, on the attic storey, the single window with three lights in the large dormer, the single opening in the small dormer and the pair of windows and single window in the turret
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window glazing which includes stained glass in the upper four lights of the bay window on the second floor
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary entrance with its broad arch of sandstone, canted walls with small windows and pair of doors
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative terracotta elements including the sandstone belt courses and window sills, terracotta reliefs on the arch, wrapping the turret between the first and second storeys and the terracotta finials and
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative brick elements including the bands of alternating projecting brick headers between the top of the second storey and the eaves and third storey and in the recessed panels under the central pair of windows at the second storey

It is proposed that the recommendations and by-law amendments be adopted at the Council meeting to be held on May 14, 2019 or at a subsequent meeting.
If adopted by City Council, the proposed amendments and recommendations will:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amend Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 354, Apartment Buildings to require building owners/operators under the RentSafeTO program to maintain a voluntary contact list of tenants who may require additional assistance during periods of evacuation or temporary discontinuance of vital services, and who choose to voluntarily self-identify to the building owner/operator and City officials as needing assistance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amend Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 354, Apartment Buildings to require building owners/operators under the RentSafeTO program to develop an electrical maintenance plan with a Licensed Electrical Contractor certified by the Electrical Safety Authority, and maintain any information and records necessary to demonstrate compliance with the electrical safety maintenance plan, when requested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amend Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 354, Apartment Buildings to require building owners/operators to retain logs of service and maintenance conducted on electrical systems including the date and nature of service and name of certified tradesperson, if applicable, and maintain the logs in a secure and accessible manner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request that the Province of Ontario amend the Electrical Safety Code to mandate regular inspections of electrical systems in all buildings.

710 YONGE STREET
Reasons for Designation
The property at 710 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the category of contextual value.
Description
The property at 710 Yonge Street contains a two-storey commercial building dating to 1909 that was commissioned by the Yonge Street Realty Company headed by Frederick B. Robins and designed by Toronto architect, George R. Harper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It anchors the south end of the intact group of five commercial buildings at 710-718 Yonge Street that, following their identification as &ldquo;contributing heritage properties&rdquo; in the Historic Yonge Street Heritage Conservation District (HCD) Plan, were listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; The northernmost unit of the group at 718 Yonge Street was individually designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1026-2017.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 710 Yonge Street is valued for the design of the building as a representative example of a &ldquo;Main Street Row&rdquo; identified by the two-storey scale, the glazed storefront with residential or commercial units in the upper floor, and the Edwardian Classical styling popular for early 20th-century commercial structures. It shares its appearance with the adjoining buildings at 712, 714 and 716 Yonge Street, which were designed at the same time, along with the neighbouring structure at 718 Yonge Street (which is currently overclad).
Contextually, the property at 710 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value for its contribution to the character of Yonge Street, south of Bloor Street, which is typified by the surviving buildings, both individual and in groups, which are historically linked to the metamorphosis of Yonge Street into Toronto&rsquo;s main commercial corridor.&nbsp; It contributes to Yonge Street&rsquo;s commercial main street character, which is expressed, in part, by mixed-use and commercial buildings that housed services, amenities and employment opportunities to support daily life in neighbouring residential areas, and which also provided cultural pursuits for the entire city.&nbsp; As such, it is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to Yonge Street, south of Bloor Street.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the commercial building at 710 Yonge Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the west side of Yonge Street, which is part of the five-part row of contiguous buildings at 710-718 Yonge Street
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork and the triangular-shaped pediment (east)
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding (the brick has been painted) and the brick, stone and wood detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Yonge Street (east) elevation where, above the first-floor storefront (which has been altered), the trio of flat-headed window openings are separated by brick pilasters with coping and have stone sills and stone lintels incorporating rondels with floral motifs

482 WELLINGTON STREET WEST
Reasons for Designation
The property at 482 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 482 Wellington Street West contains a five-storey warehouse dating to 1907 that was commissioned by Mandel Granatstein for his rag processing and junk dealing businesses and designed by Toronto architect J.A. Harvey.&nbsp; The property, along with the adjoining site at 488 Wellington Street West (which contains a complementary warehouse built in 1918), was retained by M. Granatstein and Sons of Toronto Limited until 1982.
The property at 482 Wellington Street West was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 482 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Significance
The property at 482 Wellington Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to an early-20th century warehouse.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building displays the hallmarks of the style with the tripartite organization of the principal (south) elevation, the sombre red brick cladding, the symmetrical placement of the openings, and the modest classical detailing with the banded brick pilasters and the brick corbelling beneath the south roofline.
The associative value of the property at 482 Wellington Street West is through its connection with Mandel Granatstein, who commissioned the warehouse as part of a complex of industrial buildings.&nbsp; Granatstein was a Polish emigrant who established rag processing and junk dealing enterprises in The Ward, the Toronto neighbourhood that was the centre of the Jewish community in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.&nbsp; By 1907 when Granatstein unveiled his first custom-built warehouse in King-Spadina, he was regarded as one of the most successful Jewish businessmen in the city.&nbsp;
Granatstein was noted for commissioning Benjamin Brown, Toronto's first practicing Jewish architect, to design his family residence on St. George Street (which included a retractable roof for Sukkoth observances), as well as for his role as a co-founder and supporter of the Henry Street Shul, the forerunner to the Beth Jacob Synagogue.&nbsp;
Until his death in 1945, Granatstein operated his businesses with his three sons, who retained the adjoining warehouses at 482 and 488 Wellington Street West until 1982.
The Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West is valued for its association with Toronto architect J. A. (James Arthur) Harvey, who was particularly noted for his solo practice that began in the late-19th century and focused on residential buildings in Toronto's up-and-coming residential neighbourhoods, as well as the first generation of walk-up apartment blocks in the city.&nbsp; The property at 482 Wellington Street West contains one of Harvey's rare documented commissions for an industrial building.
The property at 482 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community.&nbsp; The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place.&nbsp; As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West.&nbsp; It was among the earliest warehouses constructed on the north side of the street.
Contextually, the Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.&nbsp; In King-Spadina, the property at 482 Wellington Street reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th-century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses including the Granatstein Building lined most of the street.&nbsp; The subject building is historically and visually linked to its surroundings where it is adjoined by the Granatstein Building (1918) at 488 Wellington Street West.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Granatstein Building on the property at 482 Wellington Street West are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street, east of Portland Street
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork on the south end
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into three bays by the pilasters with brick banding
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, above the first (ground) floor (which has been altered), the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched window openings with the brick and stone detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, with the flat-headed window openings that are viewed from Wellington Street West
The glazed rooftop addition, dating to the 1990s, and the ground-floor link to the adjoining building at 488 Wellington Street West are not identified as heritage attributes.
488 WELLINGTON STREET WEST
Reasons for Designation
The property at 488 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 488 Wellington Street West contains a five-storey warehouse dating to 1918 that was commissioned by Mandel Granatstein for his rag processing and junk dealing businesses and designed by Toronto architect J.A. Harvey.&nbsp; The property, along with the adjoining site at 482 Wellington Street West (which contains a complementary warehouse built in 1907), was retained by M. Granatstein and Sons of Toronto Limited until 1982.
The property at 488 Wellington Street West was included on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1973.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 488 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Significance
The property at 488 Wellington Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to an early-20th century warehouse.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building displays the hallmarks of the style with the tripartite organization of the principal (south) elevation with the extended centre bay, the sombre red brick cladding, and the symmetrical placement of the openings.&nbsp; It is particularly distinguished by the artificial stone applied for the base (south), the classically-detailed south entrance, the extended lintels and sills on the flat-headed window openings on the south elevation (that extend to the southerly bays on the east and west side walls), and the cornice with the dome-shaped finials at the south end of the flat roofline.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building (1918) was noted at the time of its construction for its innovative (at that time) concrete structure that was exposed on the side walls with the grid-like placement of the fenestration.
The associative value of the property at 488 Wellington Street West is through its connection with Mandel Granatstein, who commissioned the warehouse as part of a complex of industrial buildings.&nbsp; Granatstein was a Polish emigrant who established rag processing and junk dealing enterprises in The Ward, the Toronto neighbourhood that was the centre of the Jewish community in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.&nbsp; By 1907 when Granatstein unveiled his first custom-built warehouse in King-Spadina, he was regarded as one of the most successful Jewish businessmen in the city.&nbsp; Granatstein was noted for commissioning Benjamin Brown, Toronto's first practicing Jewish architect, to design his family residence on St. George Street (which included a retractable roof for Sukkoth observances), as well as for his role as a co-founder and supporter of the Henry Street Shul, the forerunner to the Beth Jacob Synagogue.&nbsp; Until his death in 1945, Granatstein operated his businesses with his three sons, who retained the adjoining warehouses at 482 and 488 Wellington Street West until 1982.
The Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West is also valued for its association with the Toronto architectural firm of Hynes, Feldman and Watson, which had a short but notable practice beginning in 1915 that was headed by architect J. P. (James Patrick Hynes) and interrupted by the untimely death in 1919 of Isadore Feldman and the subsequent departure to New York City of Albert Edward Watson.&nbsp; While working together, the architects designed three venues for the Allen Theatre chain (including the extant building now known as the Danforth Music Hall), additions to St. Michael's Hospital and a small number of industrial edifices, including the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West.
The property at 488 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community.&nbsp; The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place.&nbsp; As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West that, with the earlier (1907) warehouse at 482 Wellington, formed a small-scale manufacturing complex in the block.
Contextually, the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.&nbsp; In King-Spadina, the property at 488 Wellington Street reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th-century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses including the Granatstein Building lined most of the street.&nbsp; The subject building is historically and visually linked to its surroundings where it is adjoined by the original Granatstein Building (1907) at 482 Wellington Street West.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Granatstein Building on the property at 488 Wellington Street West are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street, east of Portland Street
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan above the raised base with the window openings (south) and the artificial stone facing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick and artificial stone detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the artificial stone cornice and dentils at the south end
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into three bays, with an extended centre bay, by the pilasters that are surmounted by artificial stone dome-shaped finials
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, the placement of the main entrance in the left (west) bay of the first (ground) floor in a classically-detailed surround, and the symmetrically-placed flat-headed window openings with the continuous artificial stone lintels and sills
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, where the grid-work pattern of flat-headed window openings in artificial stone surrounds is continued in the southerly bays

710,Notice of Intention to Designate - 440 Unwin Avenue (Richard L. Hearn Generating Station),"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-05-16 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 440 Unwin Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 440 Unwin Avenue, (Richard L. Hearn Generating Station), is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located in the Port Lands, on the north side of Unwin Avenue, between Cherry and Leslie streets, the property contains the Richard L. Hearn Generating Station, a massive brick-clad structure, 41-metres high, with an adjacent concrete chimney stack of 213 metres visible from multiple points in the city.&nbsp; The property also included an area for a switching station and transmission towers, a large coal pit, railway spurs, various outbuildings used for managing water intake and discharge and ancillary structures&nbsp;&nbsp; and a formally landscaped drive to the main, west-facing, entrance.&nbsp; The station was designed in 1949 by the Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation, opened in 1951 with plans for an extension which was completed in 1961. The concrete chimney stack was added to the property in 1971, replacing the previous eight chimney stacks.&nbsp; The station was decommissioned in 1983.&nbsp; The station interiors were initially transformed to accommodate film and television studio production and subsequently stabilized between 2014 and 2016 to host large public events such as Luminato.&nbsp;&nbsp; The building's context has evolved on its south side with a waterfront park which includes the Martin Goodman Trail and the adjacent Leslie Street Spit with its renowned abundance of animal and plant species, the Tommy Thomson Trail and the Outer Harbour Marina.
The property was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2003. The Province of Ontario included it on the List of Provincial Heritage Properties in 2016 until November 2018 when the site was sold.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Hearn Generating Station has design value as a rare representative of a mid-20th century, steam power plant whose composition of diverse rectangular forms and single chimney stack is representative of the original processes which converted coal to steam and then electricity.&nbsp; The generating station exhibits a high degree of artistic merit in the principle, west, elevation of the Hearn which unites the three, large, rectilinear power-plant volumes with the lower administration block through a skillful application of the mid-century Style Moderne style.&nbsp; The artistic effect of the style is based in the simple geometric forms, the smooth, unrelieved, brick-clad surfaces which are offset by the dramatic linear patterns of the vertical banding of the modernist glass-block windows, framed with limestone piers, on the plant sections and the contrasting horizontal limestone banding around the windows of the administration block.&nbsp; Set at the top of a limestone staircase, the central principal entrance, with its combination of smooth limestone piers and the use of metal alloys in its curving canopy and paired entry doors, signals at once both the traditional gravitas of a civic institution combined with the modernity that is evident in the rest of the west elevation.&nbsp; In its structural capacity to provide the foundations and structure to both house, and support, the equipment of this vastly-scaled power generating station, along with its slip-form concrete chimney of 213 metres, the Hearn displays a high degree of technical achievement.&nbsp;
The Hearn property is valued for its historic value and association as power station built at the end of World War II by Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario (HEPCO), the provincial body now known as the Ontario Power Generation (OPG), to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for the City of Toronto for the booming post-war economy.&nbsp; With evolving supply and environmental concerns, the commission replaced coal burning with natural gas and installed the 213m chimney in 1971.&nbsp;
The Hearn is significant as it is associated with the development of the 1912 Harbour Commission plan for the Port Lands as a newly created waterfront which was intended to support shipping, industry, as well as, waterfront parks and recreation. Its location in the Port Lands enabled the supply of coal and water necessary for the generating station processes.
The property also has value for its association with Richard L. Hearn, Chief Engineer and Chairman of (HEPCO).&nbsp; An award-winning engineer, for over 40 years, Hearn made a substantial contribution to the development of Ontario's power supply through the construction of numerous facilities, two of which broke records for size, in the completion of the first synthetic rubber plant, considered to a great Canadian construction achievement, as well as for the development of atomic energy uses for peacetime and nuclear energy.&nbsp; In 1967 he was appointed the Chancellor of Brock University and received the Order of Canada in 1973.
The Hearn is valued as it reflects the work of the engineering firm of Stone &amp; Webster, established in Boston in 1889 and from the beginning specializing in the design, construction and management of power plants becoming leaders in the field to the point where it is estimated that 20% of all power generators in the United States originated with this firm.
Contextually, the Hearn is valued as it defines, supports and maintains the historic industrial character of the Port Lands.&nbsp; Initially designed as a coal-based generating station, relying on the supply of coal via rail links and water from the shipping channel, the Hearn was typical of the industrial uses intended for the Port Lands.&nbsp; Since its closure in 1983, it has been characteristic of the regeneration and adaptive reuse of the historic Port Lands structures as it has been leased by a film studio and more recently used as a temporary setting for the annual Luminato festival.
Located on the north side of Unwin Avenue since 1949, the generating station has been historically, visually and functionally linked to the industrial and institutional uses as well as the parklands and recreational trails of the Port Lands and the Leslie Street Spit for over 70 years.&nbsp; With its impressive mass and 213-metre chimney, the Hearn is a landmark, a ""symbol of the Port Lands, seen from multiple vantage points.&nbsp; It terminates the southern views down Carlaw Avenue, as well as Logan Avenue and Bouchette Street.&nbsp; The view of the chimney has also been anticipated to terminate Broadview Avenue when it is extended.&nbsp; From the east and west the chimney is viewed from both ends of Unwin Avenue at Leslie and Cherry streets.&nbsp; At a city scale, it is a contributing feature of Toronto's waterfront skyline.

717,Notice of Intention to Designate - 28 – 30 Langley Avenue ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-05-17 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council stated its intention to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 28 &ndash; 30 Langley Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
28 &ndash; 30 LANGLEY AVENUE
Reasons for Designation
The property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the north side of the street, east of Broadview Avenue, the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue contains a pair of 2&frac12;-storey semi-detached houses that, following the issuance of a building permit to the property owner and contractor William C. Jones in November 1892 that identified George Martel Miller as the architect, were under construction the following year (1893).&nbsp; Standing vacant for five years, the semi-detached house at 28 Langley Avenue was first occupied in 1898 by Reverend Enoch Barker, a Congregational minister.&nbsp; The following year, Louis J. Thomas and his family began a lengthy tenancy of 30 Langley Avenue that lasted until Thomas's death in 1913.&nbsp; Subsequently, his widow, Jennie Rife Thomas, purchased the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue with both houses.&nbsp; Archival records indicate that the Thomas Estate retained the property until the 1950s when it was converted to a legal rooming house.
Statement of Significance
The property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is valued for the exceptionally highly-crafted design of the pair of semi-detached houses in the Queen Anne Revival style that was popular at the end of the 19th century and identified by the mixture of materials, intricate rooflines and variety of architectural detailing.&nbsp; The William C. Jones Houses are particularly distinguished by the composition anchored by corner towers with turrets and original stained glass windows, and the sandstone cladding covering most of the principal (south) elevations.
The William C. Jones Houses are historically associated with George Martel Miller (1854-1933), the Toronto architect who is credited with their design.&nbsp; In solo practice in Toronto for nearly half a century where the Gladstone Hotel (1894) on Queen Street West was amongst his early projects, Miller became known for his commissions for the famous Massey family, particularly the iconic Massey Music Hall (1894, in association with Cleveland architect, Sidney R. Badgley).&nbsp; Miller's extensive portfolio included residential buildings in Toronto's up-and-coming neighbourhoods where the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is a rare documented example of his work in Riverdale.
Contextually, the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue has cultural heritage value for its role in maintaining, supporting and defining the historical character of the street and the adjoining area as it developed as a middle-class enclave in Riverdale with well-crafted detached and semi-detached houses from the late-19th and early-20th century.&nbsp; The William C. Jones Houses are also historically, visually and physically linked to their setting on Langley Avenue on one of the original few lots not subdivided where they stand prominent in the street with the grandeur of their scale, roofline and distinctive architectural detailing.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the William C. Jones Houses at 28-30 Langley Avenue are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the north side of the street, east of Broadview Avenue
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey plans, with the sandstone bases with the window openings (south)
-&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering the buildings, the hipped roof (south) with the flared eaves, the metal finial and the corner towers (southwest and southeast), the cross-gable roofs (east and west) with the enclosed gables and the wood detailing, the gambrel roof (north), the shed-roof dormers (east and west), and the brick chimneys
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick and sandstone cladding, and the brick, stone, wood and metal detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevations, which are arranged as mirror images with the main entrances placed side-by-side in the first (ground) floor and accessed through round-arched portals with sandstone detailing (beneath the transoms, the doors have been replaced, as well as the steps leading to the entries)
-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevations, in the second storey, the flat-headed openings with transoms that are protected by an open porch with a classical column
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The corner towers (southeast and southwest) with the round-arched openings in the first (ground) floor, some of which contain stained glass windows, the flat-headed window openings in the upper stories, the conical roofs with the extended eaves with brackets, and the metal finials
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The sandstone detailing on the south elevations, with the lintels, continuous sills and band courses
-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side elevations (east and west) with the brick detailing and the two-storey bay windows with the flat-headed openings, the brick flat arches and the stone sills

801,Notice of Intention to Designate - 206 Russell Hill Road ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-06-21 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council stated its intention to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 206 Russell Hill Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
206 RUSSELL HILL ROAD
Reasons for Designation
The property at 206 Russell Hill Road is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the west side of the street, south of St. Clair Avenue West in the South Hill neighbourhood, the property at 206 Russell Hill Road is elevated on a hillside where the lot extends west to Sir Winston Churchill Park.&nbsp; It contains a 2&frac12;-storey detached house form building that was constructed in 1910 for William Sefton Hodgens (1878-1963) according to the designs of Toronto architect Ewart G. Wilson.&nbsp; Hodgens was a self-made financier and one of the original directors of the Dominion Securities Corporation (forerunner to today&rsquo;s RBC Securities) who resided at 206 Russell Hill with his wife, Margaret Wood Meikle for over half a century.&nbsp; Following Hodgens&rsquo;s death, the Basilian Fathers of Toronto were among the subsequent owners of the property.&nbsp;
Statement of Significance
The property at 206 Russell Hill Road is valued for its design as a well-crafted example of the Period Revival, one of the most popular styles for upscale residential architecture in the World War I era, which is particularly distinguished by its detailing inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement.&nbsp; The William S. Hodgens House displays hallmarks of the style in its varied cladding, the intricate profile incorporating the roof with the gambrel form, extended east slope, parapets and multiple chimneys, and the varied fenestration including bay windows and shed-roof dormers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The William S. Hodgens House is historically associated with the origins of the South Hill neighbourhood where, following the subdivision of the former Russell Hill estate, it occupied one of the larger tracts adjoining the Nordheimer Ravine.&nbsp; It is also linked to the practice of Ewart G. Wilson who, in a career spanning a quarter-century, was noted for his residential commissions in Rosedale, Forest Hill and other prestigious neighbourhoods, and elegant apartment houses, including the Broadview Mansions (1927), the listed heritage property overlooking Riverdale Park.
Contextually, the William S. Hodgens House supports and maintains the historical character of the South Hill community as an early-20th century residential enclave with recognized heritage buildings on Clarendon Avenue, Clarendon Crescent, Warren Road, Balmoral Avenue and Poplar Plains Road, as well as Russell Hill Road.&nbsp;&nbsp; The property at 206 Russell Hill Road is also historically, visually and physically linked to its location on an elevated site adjoining Sir Winston Churchill Park.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the William S. Hodgens House at 206 Russell Hill Road are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the west side of the street, south of St. Clair Avenue West and adjoining Sir Winston Churchill Park
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey plan
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roof with the gambrel form, extended slope and multiple shed-roof dormers (east), the parapets (east and west) and the four brick chimneys, including the oversized chimney on the east end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation, where the main entrance is placed off-centre in the first (ground) floor and protected by the open gable on brackets and the stepped stone wall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north side elevation with the secondary entrance and the wood detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On all elevations, the fenestration that incorporates flat-headed openings with stone lintels or wood surrounds, segmental-arched openings with brick flat arches and stone sills, and bay windows with wood detailing (some of the openings have been altered)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many of the openings, the multi-paned windows that reflect the Period Revival styling
The detached garage at the north end of the property is not identified as a heritage attribute.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 1 Blue Goose Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description:
The property at 1 Blue Goose Street is located southeast of the intersection of Royal York Road and the railway tracks in Mimico.&nbsp; It contains a 3&frac12;-storey building (1909) that is known historically as the Windsor Hotel, which replaced a late-19th century hostelry on the same site where it continued to serve the passengers and crews of the Grand Trunk Railway (afterward Canadian National Railways), as well as the local community.&nbsp; The site was renamed the Blue Goose Tavern in 1971.&nbsp; The property at 1 Blue Goose Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2017.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:
The property at 1 Blue Goose Street has cultural heritage value for its design as a well-preserved early-20th century commercial building with features of Edwardian Classicism, which emerged as the most popular style prior to World War in reaction to the architectural excesses of the late Victorian era.&nbsp; The Windsor Hotel displays the plain brick surfaces, the geometrical lines with the hipped roof and dormers, and the symmetrical placement of the openings identified with the Edwardian Classical style.
The Windsor Hotel is associated with the history of Mimico, from its origins as a community linked to the railway, to its development and evolution as an independent municipality.&nbsp; A railway hotel has existed in this locality since the late 19th century when it was built in close proximity to the tracks and the Grand Trunk Railway (later Canadian National Railways) station.&nbsp; As a community hub with its links to Mimico's sports culture, the hotel has been in continuous operation for more than a century.
Contextually, the property at 1 Blue Goose is historically and visually related to its setting southeast of the railway tracks and Royal York Road in Mimico with its proximity to the original location of Mimico Station (the latter building is now found in Centennial Park on the west side of Royal York Road).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windsor Hotel remains a local landmark in the community.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes:
The heritage attributes of the Windsor Hotel on the property at 1 Blue Goose Street are:
-&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Blue Goose Street and Manchester Street
-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 3&frac12;-storey building with the square-shaped plan
-&nbsp; The hipped roof with the brick chimney (south) and the hipped dormers on all of the slopes
-&nbsp; The brick cladding with the brick and stone detailing
-&nbsp; On the principal (west) and side (north and south) elevations, above the first floor (which has been altered), the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched window openings with the brick flat arches and the stone sills

Reasons for Designation
The property at 50 Eglinton Avenue West is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value.&nbsp; It meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 50 Eglinton Avenue West is located on the northwest corner of Duplex Avenue, west of Yonge Street in the Yonge-Eglinton neighbourhood and the historic community of North Toronto.&nbsp; It contains the building known historically as the Eglinton Substation, which was constructed in 1922 by the Toronto Hydro-Electric System to provide power for the extension of the electric street railway, the existing radial railway on Yonge Street, and the Eglinton Carhouse (1922, and no longer extant) at the southwest corner of Yonge and Eglinton.
In 2017, the property at 50 Eglinton Avenue West was identified for its potential cultural heritage value in the Midtown in Focus: Cultural Heritage Resource Assessment (CHER).
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 50 Eglinton Avenue West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to a hydro substation from the interwar period that was custom-designed for the Toronto Hydro-Electric System.&nbsp; As the most popular style of architecture for most building types in the early decades of the 20th century, Eglinton Substation exemplifies the style in the somber brick cladding with the stone detailing on the door and window surrounds, coping and cornice, with the latter incorporating a name band reading &ldquo;Toronto Hydro-Electric System&rdquo; on the principal (south) elevation.
The associative value of the Eglinton Substation is through its links to the beginnings of the Toronto Hydro-Electric System (THES), which began operations in 1911 as a public company designed to deliver electric power from Niagara Falls in the expanding city, a role previously undertaken by private enterprises.&nbsp; As a new entity, the THES employed in-house design staff, principally A. E. Salisbury who first updated existing substations across the city before presenting a template for new buildings that shared a similar classically-inspired design aesthetic, with the Eglinton Substation amongst the earliest examples.&nbsp; The building was the first substation opened by the Toronto Hydro-Electric System in North Toronto and powered the expanded electric street railway, the existing radial railway and the new Eglinton Carhouse under the direction of the recently founded Toronto Transportation Commission (forerunner to today&rsquo;s Toronto Transit Commission or TTC). The Eglinton Substation pre-dated the Glengrove Substation (1930) on Yonge Street, north of Eglinton Avenue, another institutional landmark in North Toronto that is recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Contextually, the Eglinton Substation anchors the northwest corner of Eglinton and Duplex avenues, one block west of Yonge Street where it is a highly visible feature with its location, vintage and appearance.&nbsp; It stands as an institutional landmark in North Toronto.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Eglinton Substation at 50 Eglinton Avenue West are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the northwest corner of Duplex Avenue
- &nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the building, which rises two extended stories on the sloped site with the raised base that is higher at the south end and has stone band courses and flat-headed window openings on the south, east and north elevations
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the stone coping and stone cornice that extends from the south elevation to the west and north elevations and incorporates a name band reading &ldquo;Toronto Hydro-Electric System&rdquo; on the south end
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is symmetrically organized into three bays with the central entrance in the first (ground) floor that is flanked and surmounted by flat-headed openings with stone surrounds and multi-paned windows
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The main (south) entrance, where the pair of wood doors with glazing is placed in the classically-detailed surround with the entablature, mouldings and brackets
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The east side elevation facing Duplex Avenue and the rear (north) elevation (the latter is viewed from Duplex Avenue), which continue the pattern of symmetrically-placed flat-headed window openings with stone surrounds
The west elevation is concealed by the adjoining building at 60 Eglinton Avenue West.
Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Francine Adamo, Administrator, North York Community Council, North York Civic Centre, 5100 Yonge Street, Ground floor, Toronto, Ontario, M2N 5V7, within thirty days of August 26, 2019, which is September 25, 2019.

1183,Notice of Intention to Designate - 28 Bracken Avenue ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-10-10 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council stated its intention to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 28 Bracken Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
28 Bracken Avenue
Reasons for Designation
The property at 28 Bracken Avenue, containing a house-form building is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located in the Balmy Beach neighbourhood on the north side of the street between Kingswood and Bingham Avenues, the property at 28 Bracken Avenue contains a two-and-a-half storey house-form building constructed in 1915-16 and first owned by Clara and Arthur G. Hill. Located on a corner lot, the house includes garage facing Bingham Avenue and at one time also included a tennis court which was located at 26 Bracken Avenue.&nbsp; The property is within close proximity to the Kingswood Road South Heritage Conservation District which is located south of Bracken Avenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Clara and Arthur G. Hill house, with its complementary garage, has design value as an excellent representative of the Arts and Crafts Movement, rendered in the Shingle Style, evident in the complex massing, sweeping roofs, combination of gable and hip dormers, projecting bay window, deep verandah with buff brick and shingle cladding.&nbsp; A high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit is shown in the construction of the house which skillfully resolves the complex massing through expert design and carpentry.&nbsp; Further artistic merit is seen in the detailing of the flaring eaves with the tapered rafters ends and the unusual verandah supports with their combination of tripled brick piers of varying heights.&nbsp; The gate posts at the entrance walkway and the garage structure to the north have been built to be consistent with the materials, forms, craftsmanship and detailing of the house, contributing to the overall design value of the property.
As one of the earliest houses on Bracken Avenue, the Hill house is valued for its historic association with the early 20th-century development of the Balmy Beach neighbourhood.&nbsp; The house has historical and associative value as it was the home of Kildare Dobbs, the well-known Irish-Canadian poet and novelist and Member of the Order of Canada, and Kathleen Ptolemy, who served as the Secretary of the Canadian Council of Refugees.
Located at the corner of Bracken and Bingham Avenues in the heart of the Balmy Beach neighbourhood and the adjacent Kingswood Road South HCD, the Hill House with its Arts and Crafts architecture and Shingle Style details has contextual value as it defines and maintains the Arts and Crafts character of the residential architecture of this neighbourhood including a fine collection of houses on Bingham Avenue and Kingswood and Scarborough roads. Constructed in 1915-1916 and the second house to be completed on Bracken Avenue, Hill house is functionally, historically and visually linked to its surroundings.&nbsp; Prominently sited on its corner lot and viewed from two streets, the house, with its complex massing of roofs, dormers and deep verandah and its finely crafted details is a local architectural landmark.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 28 Bracken Avenue are:
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the house and garage on the property at the north-west corner of Bracken and Bingham avenues
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house-form building which includes the sweeping gable roof, with its gable and hipped roof dormers and its extension over the first floor porch, the roof skirt which is featured on parts of all four elevations, including the gable dormer and the projecting double storey bay window on the south elevation, and the brick chimneys on the east and west elevations

The properties at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue are worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the north side of the street, the properties contain a pair of single-storey semi-detached house form buildings that were among the 16 pairs of workers' cottages completed in 1858 on the subdivision developed by solicitor and realtor James Lukin Robinson on the former Military Reserve lands east of Garrison Creek that were also known as the Garrison Common.&nbsp; Today, six pairs of the original cottages remain on Mitchell Avenue and Richmond Street West, including those at 703-705 and 719-719 Richmond that were listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2005, and the subject properties at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue.
Statement of Significance
The properties at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue have design value as a pair of single-storey semi-detached workers' cottages that are rare early surviving examples of this typology in Toronto.&nbsp; They are part of the extant collection of six of the original 16 pairs that were completed in 1858 when Boulton illustrated them on the first fire insurance atlas covering the city.&nbsp; The semi-detached houses feature the near-square plans, low hipped roofs and symmetrical placement of the door and window openings inspired by the bungalow that originated in India, which influenced the early-19th century Regency Cottage and, on a more modest scale, the vernacular workers' cottage.
The Robinson Cottages, also known as the Garrison Common Cottages, at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue contribute to the historical development and evolution of the Niagara Street neighbourhood that occupies part of the acreage set aside for military purposes after the founding of York (Toronto) in the late 18th century.&nbsp; In 1834, with the westward expansion of the newly incorporated City of Toronto and the desire to fund additional military installations in defence of the community, land in the Military Reserve east of Garrison Creek was identified for development.&nbsp; On Garrison Common, the tract southeast of present-day Queen and Niagara streets where the subject properties are found was granted in the mid-1840s to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, an Anglican missionary organization, which did not develop the land.&nbsp; A decade later, James Lukin Robinson, a prolific local developer and realtor, who was also a solicitor and member of a famous Toronto family, registered a residential subdivision where he commissioned 16 pairs of brick cottages that were in place when Boulton's Atlas was published in 1858.&nbsp; The original occupants included tradespeople, as well as workers for the inaugural steam railways that transformed Toronto in the mid-19th century.&nbsp; The properties at 71-75 Mitchell Avenue are important reminders of the origins of the Niagara Street neighbourhood.
Contextually, the properties at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue are part of the collection of surviving workers' cottages on Mitchell Avenue and Richmond Street West that were among the first residential buildings constructed in the area where they define, support and maintain the historical character of the Niagara Street neighbourhood south of Queen Street West.&nbsp; The Robinson Cottages at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue are also historically, visually and physically linked to their original settings where they were laid out in relation to the other pairs of semi-detached cottages on Mitchell Avenue and Richmond and Adelaide streets, of which six pairs (including the subject properties) remain today.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Robinson Cottages (also known as the Garrison Common Cottages) at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue are:
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the pair of semi-detached buildings on the north side of the street between Tecumseth and Niagara streets
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the single-storey rectangular-shaped plans
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hipped roofs covering the buildings (the central chimney has been removed)
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials (the brick on 40 Mitchell has been covered)

Reasons for Designation
Hotel Mossop
The property at 56 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 56 Yonge Street contains the building known historically as the Hotel Mossop, an eight-storey commercial building that was commissioned by businessman, Frederick W. Mossop and completed in 1908 according to the designs of Toronto architect J. P. Hynes.&nbsp; Its construction was interrupted by delays related to financing and the challenges of developing the site in the city&rsquo;s Financial District and, while opening as an exclusive 60-room hotel with many amenities, its operation was stymied by the passage of the Ontario Temperance Act in 1916.&nbsp; Closing the following year, the Hotel Mossop was flagged as one of two hotels to take overflow patients during the Spanish Influenza epidemic in 1918.&nbsp; The business continued to operate under its original name in the 1920s (as advertised in local newspapers), but reopened as the Hotel Victoria in 1928 when it was branded the &ldquo;most exclusive small hotel in Canada&rdquo; under the operation of George and Matthew Elliott.&nbsp; The hotel survived the economic downturn of lower Yonge Street during the World War II era and, after several changes in ownership, was updated in the mid 1980s as an upscale boutique establishment.&nbsp; The property at 56 Yonge Street was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Inventory (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1983.
Statement of Significance
The building known historically as the Hotel Mossop at 56 Yonge Street has design value as a well-crafted early-20th century commercial building with Edwardian Classical styling.&nbsp; Popularized for almost all building types in the period before World War I, Edwardian Classicism was inspired by classical architecture and identified by its symmetry and the decorative detailing drawn from antiquity.&nbsp; The Hotel Mossop is an excellent example of the style where the materials and architectural features are used to emphasize the tripartite design with the base, shaft and cornice.&nbsp; It is particularly distinguished by the stone detailing applied for the semi-engaged columns, the banding on the piers, the cornices and the distinctive arched parapet on the roofline.
The property at 56 Yonge Street has value for its association with the temperance movement in Ontario in the early 20th century when the Hotel Mossop was one of the hostelries impacted by the prohibition of alcohol, resulting in the closure of the venue by the original owners.&nbsp; Historically, it is also associated with Toronto architect J. P. (James Patrick) Hynes who designed the Hotel Mossop while he oversaw a solo practice between 1894 and 1914.&nbsp; While Hynes is identified with upscale residential buildings in Toronto&rsquo;s exclusive neighbourhoods, including Rosedale and Deer Park, as well as churches and schools for Roman Catholic parishes, he designed six hotels in the city, including the subject building.&nbsp; Afterward, he oversaw the seven-year partnership of Hynes, Feldman and Watson that was distinguished by commissions for the Allen Theatre chain, including the extant complex now known as the Danforth Music Hall.&nbsp; Resuming his solo career, Hynes completed St. Peter&rsquo;s Roman Catholic Church on Bathurst Street, which is among many of his projects that are included on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Contextually, the Hotel Mossop supports and maintains the historical character of lower Yonge Street as it developed in the late-19th and early-20th century as Toronto&rsquo;s new Financial District and is reflected in the collection of extant commercial buildings that are recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.&nbsp; This group includes the former stores, hotel and banks preserved in Brookfield Place (formerly BCE Place), as well as the Bank of British North America and A. V. Brown Building (both designed by the notable early Toronto architect, John G. Howard) that marked the emergence of the Yonge and Wellington corners as a financial centre.&nbsp; This was followed in the pre-World War I era with the construction by the major banks of the city&rsquo;s first skyscrapers adjoining the intersection of Yonge and King streets.&nbsp; With its location between Wellington and King, the Hotel Mossop (later known as the Hotel Victoria) is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Toronto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street.&rdquo;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Hotel Mossop (afterward known as the Hotel Victoria) at 56 Yonge Street are:
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the west side of Yonge Street, north of Wellington Street West
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and setting of the 8-storey building with the L-shaped plan
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick and stone cladding and detailing
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the stone cornice and the centrally-placed arched parapet on the east end
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation, which is symmetrically organized into three sections by the materials and detailing, as well as the cornices above the first and second stories, and extends five bays above the first (ground) floor
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation, the first floor (which has been altered and where the doors are not original) with the stone semi-engaged columns and the banded stone piers, the second storey where the flat-headed window openings are separated by brick piers with stone bands, and the upper six stories with the plain brick piers that organize the flat-headed window openings with the stone lintels and sills and, in the upper floor, the round-arched window openings with the brick and stone hood moulds
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The side elevations (north and south) are concealed by the adjoining buildings and, along with the rear elevations of the L-shaped plan, are not identified as heritage attributes.

Reasons for Designation
300 Bloor Street West
The property at 300 Bloor Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located at the north-west corner of Bloor Street West and Huron Street, the property at 300 Bloor Street contains a complex of religious buildings, first known as the Bloor Street Presbyterian Church and, as of 1925, the Bloor Street United Church, which has undergone a series of alterations designed by various architects between 1888 and 1962.&nbsp; The first building, including a church and Sunday school, was designed by the architect George W. E. Field and constructed between 1886 and 1888.&nbsp; It forms the north-east corner of the church complex.&nbsp; Within a year of the building's completion, in response to the growing population of the recently annexed Annex neighbourhood, a new church, designed by William R. Gregg, was constructed to the south of the first building and completed in 1890.&nbsp; The new church features a prominent corner tower which continues to be a landmark at the north-west corner of Bloor Street West and Huron Street.&nbsp; In 1908-1909, the first building, then used exclusively as a Sunday school, was extended to the west providing more accommodation for the school and included the church hall.&nbsp; The extension was undertaken by the firm of Wickson &amp; (Alfred) Gregg.&nbsp;
In 1927, the church's principal (south) elevation and main entrance was impacted with the widening of Bloor Street.&nbsp; This resulted in the redesign of the south elevation by Wickson &amp; Gregg and entailed the removal of the grand staircase and the relocation of the three entry arches to a new single storey entry pavilion to the west.&nbsp; The church's narthex was given a minimal expansion to the south and nine small arched windows replaced the original three entry arches.&nbsp; Between 1927and 1954, a single-storey wing accommodating a kitchen and nursery was added to the north of the 1909 Sunday school extension.&nbsp; In 1954, a fire damaged the church and the church interior was reconstructed with a new structural system of arches and an extended choir space by the firm of Bruce, Brown and Brisley with the guidance of Professor I. S. Nairn of the University of Toronto.&nbsp; In 1956, Professor Nairn had a stone lintel carved with the name ""Bloor Street United Church"" located in the entry pavilion with the original church doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1954 and 1962, a series of stained glass windows were added to the church interiors including the main worship space, the narthex and corner entries.&nbsp; The latter commemorated the 75th anniversary of the founding of the church and resulted in the great south window which celebrates the theme of ecumenism.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 300 Bloor Street West is valued as an excellent representative of a late 19th century Gothic Revival Presbyterian church complex.&nbsp; The characteristics of the Presbyterian church-type are represented in the hall form of the church with the u-shaped gallery and a Sunday school adjacent to the principal internal wall accommodating the organ and pulpit.&nbsp; The Gothic Revival elements are evident in the spires, buttresses and lancet-shaped windows tempered by the late 19th century taste for rusticated red Credit Valley sandstone, with contrasting smooth buff-coloured Ohio sandstone trim and polished granite columns, the sense of mass in the proportions and the asymmetry of the two towers. The exterior of the complex was transformed through a series of additions and alterations between 1886 and 1927 by three different firms of architects yet retains a consistent Gothic Revival style which is due to the high level of design and craftsmanship with which each succeeding project was undertaken to create a unified whole.
The property at 300 Bloor Street West is valued for its historical association with the 1925 union of the Methodist Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches resulting in the founding of the United Church of Canada, as Dr. George Campbell Pidgeon, minister of the Bloor Street Presbyterian Church (1918-1948) and the last moderator of the Presbyterian Church would become the first moderator of the United Church of Canada.&nbsp; The property is valued for yielding information about the active social service provided by the congregation which from its earliest days and through various outreach programs, championed the needs of the disadvantaged and strove for an ethical role of the congregation within society.&nbsp; The congregation have supported refugees, adopted the 1995 Declaration of Affirmation of inclusivity regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, and have promoted reconciliation between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous people.&nbsp; The congregation shares its space with the Alpha Korean United Church and the City Shul, a Reform congregation.&nbsp;
The property is valued for its association with the earliest development of the Annex neighbourhood in the 1880s when it acquired its characteristic urban pattern and architectural form.&nbsp; The property is also valued as it demonstrates the work of the two prolific Toronto architectural firms.&nbsp; William R. Gregg, (alone and in partnership with Alfred Gregg) was renowned for a large number of church commissions in Toronto and across Ontario.&nbsp; Wickson &amp; (Alfred) Gregg were known for their substantial residential commissions as well as institutional and industrial works.&nbsp; Alfred Gregg was a Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.
Located at the north-west corner of Bloor and Huron Streets, with its prominent corner tower, the church is a landmark viewed from four directions along Bloor and Huron streets.&nbsp; With its late 19th-century picturesque massing built of rusticated Credit Valley sandstone, the church complex defines and maintains the characteristic architectural character and scale of the Annex neighbourhood.&nbsp; Constructed between 1886 and 1890 with later extensions in 1909 and 1927, the complex is historically, functionally, physically and visually linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Bloor Street United Church property are:

&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three entry arches, originally located in the south wall of the church prior to the Bloor Street widening in 1927, now located in the single story entry pavilion including the Ohio stone arches with their string mouldings and sprocket details, the red granite columns with buff stone composite capitals framing doorways with transoms with Gothic tracery

Reasons For Designation
478 Huron Street &nbsp;&nbsp;
The property at 478 Huron Street, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located on the west side of the street, north of Bloor Street West, the property at 478 Huron Street contains a two-and-a-half storey house, designed by the architect John Gemmel and constructed in 1888.&nbsp; The first owner-occupants were John H. and Eliza A. Armstrong.&nbsp; Following the demolition in 1963 of the George Campbell Pidgeon house at 476 Huron Street to make way for the construction of the new TTC Bloor-Danforth subway line, 478 Huron Street was acquired by the Bloor Street United Church trustees, named to continue the association with Dr. Pidgeon, and used as an ancillary structure for church community functions and to provide accommodation for the church caretaker.&nbsp; From the early 2000s the house has been rented for office use.&nbsp; In 1974, the property was included on the City's inaugural inventory and was one of 400 properties identified for its heritage value.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 478 Huron Street has design value as a fine representative example of a typical Annex house in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, predominant in Toronto in the late 19th century and evident in the picturesque massing and rooflines, stone, brick and terracotta-shingle cladding and in the variety of architectural details. The George Campbell Pidgeon house retains many fine details including the mullion patterning, wood details and stained glass of the windows, the brick and stone relief work and the skillful manipulation of the massing evident in the fine proportions and the curving stone wall leading to the recessed entrance. &nbsp;
Constructed in 1888, the property at 478 Huron Street is valued for its association with the early history of the Annex neighbourhood, and as one of the earliest houses on Huron Street, it represents the residential development which would give the Annex its defining character.&nbsp; It is also valued for its association with the Bloor Street United Church and Dr. George Campbell Pidgeon, who from 1915-1948 provided leadership through the union with the United Church, ecumenism and community outreach at a local and global scale.&nbsp;
The property is valued as it, and the adjacent semi-detached houses at 480-482 Huron Street, reflect the work of the architect John Gemmell, partner in the distinguished and prolific Toronto firm of Smith &amp; Gemmell, designers of over one hundred ecclesiastical, institutional and commercial buildings, including Knox College.&nbsp; Gemmel was a founder of the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA), was elected president of the OAA in 1904 and became a frequent contributor to the Canadian Architect and Builder.&nbsp;
Contextually, the Pidgeon House has cultural heritage value for its importance in defining and maintaining the historic Annex residential neighbourhood which is characterized by elaborately massed and richly detailed late-19th and early-20th century detached and semi-detached houses.&nbsp; As one of the earliest houses constructed on Huron Street north of Bloor Street, the house at 478 Bloor Street (one of three in a row designed by John Gemmel) is physically, visually and historically linked to the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes

The John S. Simmons &amp; Son Florist building has design and physical value as a representative example of an early twentieth century commercial block retaining the integrity of its original form and composition including the paired windows at the upper level and pressed metal cornice of garland swags all of which convey an early twentieth-century style rooted in Edwardian classicism with a taste for greater simplicity of surface, form and detail.&nbsp;
The property is valued for its historical associations with the history of Yonge Street, for as early as 1861 it has been occupied by a row of commercial buildings.&nbsp; In 1916, John S. Simmons &amp; Son, moved their Yonge Street florist business to this location and continued to operate at this site until the 1970s.&nbsp; &nbsp;The property is also valued as it contributes to an understanding of the history of commerce on Yonge Street with small-scale, independent businesses that occupied the ground floors and the variety of residential, recreational, educational and business facilities that occupied the upper floors.&nbsp;
Located at the north-west corner of Yonge and Elm streets, the property has contextual value as it contains a two-storey, brick-clad, early twentieth-century commercial building which contributes to and maintains the late 19th and early 20th century character of this portion of Yonge Street as well the historic character and scale of Elm Street.&nbsp; As a commercial building dating to 1913, adjacent to other late 19th century commercial buildings, it is functionally and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;

Reasons for Designation
Fire Hall No. 30 (Ashbridge's Bay Fire Hall)
The property at 39 Commissioners Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the south side of the street opposite the entrance to Munition Street, the property at 39 Commissioners Street contains the building completed in 1922 as Fire Hall No. 30, which was also known as the Ashbridge&rsquo;s Bay Fire Hall.&nbsp; It was part of a collection of fire halls either custom-designed or expanded during that decade in reaction to the continued growth of the city, including the newly developed industrial area at the east end of Toronto's central waterfront.&nbsp; Officially opened in 1929, Fire Hall No 30 served the Port Industrial District (today's Port Lands) until 1980 and was used afterward as offices for the Firefighters&rsquo; Union.&nbsp; The property was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now the Heritage Register) in 2003.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 39 Commissioners Street has cultural heritage value for the design of Fire Hall No. 30, which was among the purpose-built fire stations constructed by the City of Toronto in the 1920s that was set apart from others of this period by the modest scale, hipped roof and Edwardian Classical styling.&nbsp; Its fire hall typology is identified by the oversized opening originally designed for mechanized fire engines and the placement of the entrance on the side elevation (west) where the hose drying tower shown in drawings and illustrations was excluded from the final design.&nbsp;
Fire Hall No. 30 is associated with the Department of the City Architect, which was responsible for the design of most city-owned buildings, including those commissioned by Toronto's fire department.&nbsp; In the early 1920s when the subject building was designed, G. W. Price held the position of City Architect, overseeing the completion of the Coliseum at Exhibition Place and five purpose-built fire stations, including Fire Hall No. 30.
Fire Hall No. 30 is also linked to the historical development of the Port Industrial District (today's Port Lands), which was created in the 1920s following the introduction of plans by the Toronto Harbour Commissioners to reorganize Toronto&rsquo;s waterfront according to commercial, recreational and industrial uses.&nbsp; A key component of the municipal servicing for the area was the protection provided by a permanent fire hall.
Contextually, Fire Hall No. 30 is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Commissioners Street, east of Cherry Street, where it was placed to terminate the vista looking south on Munition Street.&nbsp; It is part of the group of institutional buildings near the intersection of Cherry and Commissioners streets, including the former bank branch (1920) and hydro substation (1928) from the same era as Fire Hall No. 30.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Ashbridge&rsquo;s Bay Fire Hall on the property at 39 Commissioners Street are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the south side of Commissioners Street opposite the entrance to Munition Street
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey plan
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering the building, the steeply-pitched hipped roof with the brick chimney
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing,
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation, where the left (east) bay extends as a frontispiece and contains an oversized opening in the first storey that was originally designed for fire equipment (the opening has been bricked in)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the remainder of the north elevation, the flat-headed window openings with the brick flat arches and the stone keystones and sills
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The side elevations (east and west), which continue the cladding, fenestration and detailing from the north elevation
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main entrance, which is placed on the west side elevation in a flat-headed surround
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north, east and west elevations, the stone detailing that is applied for the band courses at the base and beneath the roofline, the cornice dividing the first and second stories, the keystones on the door and window openings, the pediment above the equipment opening (north), and the window sills
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation and wings

Reasons for Designation
The properties at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The properties at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are located in the proposed King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD), and are identified as contributing properties in the King-Spadina HCD Plan (2017).
Located on the east side of the street between Adelaide and Richmond streets, the properties at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street contain a row of two pairs of 2&frac12;-storey house form buildings that date to 1881 in the King Spadina HCD Plan (2017). All of the subject properties are also listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register (2017).
Statement of Significance
The properties at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street have cultural heritage value for their design as residential buildings with Gothic Revival styling associated with the first wave of development in the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the 19th century. These row houses represent a key building typology in King-Spadina, which originated in the 1800s as a residential and institutional enclave where the side streets and many of the main streets were lined with detached, semi-detached and row houses. The subject properties survived the replacement of much of the residential building stock during the second phase of development of the community in the 20th century when King-Spadina became Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre. The buildings at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are distinguished by their late Victorian designs with Gothic Revival styling, particularly the centrally-placed gable on each pair with their decorative wood bargeboard.
The properties at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are valued for their association with the local builder/speculator, Francis Phillips, who built the subject properties along with the abutting heritage property directly to the north at 145 Portland Street.
Contextually, the properties at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are valued for the role of these residential buildings in defining, supporting and maintaining the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, reflecting its evolution from a 19th-century residential and institutional enclave and Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing centre in the 20th century, to its current status as a mixed-use community. The row houses at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are historically, visually and physically linked to their setting in the King-Spadina neighbourhood where they are among the small group of surviving late-19th century residential buildings, including the adjacent examples at 124-130 Portland, which are also included on the City's Heritage Register.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the buildings at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the east side of the street between Adelaide and Richmond streets
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey rectangular shaped plans
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross-gable roofs covering the buildings, where each pair has a central gable on the west slope with brackets and decorative wood bargeboard
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding, the contrasting buff brick detailing for the string course beneath the west rooflines and on the window openings, and the stone and wood trim (the brickwork is currently painted, apart from the building at 139 Portland Street)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevations, which are designed as mirror images with the main entrances placed side-by-side in segmental-arched surrounds with transoms (the open porches on the buildings at 141 and 143 Portland are not original)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west elevations, the single-storey bay windows with the segmental-arched openings and the roofs, the segmental-arched window openings in the second stories, the single round-arched attic opening under the cross-gable in each pair, and the brick segmental arches and stone sills
Note: The side (south) elevation at 139 Portland adjoins the neighbouring building. No heritage attributes are identified on the rear (east) elevations

Reasons for Designation
The property at 145 Portland Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 145 Portland Street is located in the proposed King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD), and is identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina HCD Plan (2017) for the proposed District.
Located on the east side of the street between Adelaide and Richmond streets, the property at 145 Portland Street comprises the northern anchor of a row of two pairs of 2&frac12;-storey house-form buildings that date to 1881 in the King Spadina HCD Plan (2017).
Statement of Significance
The property at 145 Portland Street has cultural heritage value for its design as a residential building with Gothic Revival styling associated with the first wave of development in the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the 19th century. As part of a row of four house-form buildings, the property at 145 Portland Street represents a key building typology in King-Spadina, which originated in the 1800s as a residential and institutional enclave where the side streets and many of the main streets were lined with detached, semi-detached and row houses.&nbsp; The subject property survived the replacement of much of the residential building stock during the second phase of development of the community in the 20th century when King-Spadina became Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre. The building at 145 Portland Street is distinguished by its late Victorian design with Gothic Revival styling, particularly the centrally-placed gable with its decorative wood bargeboard.
The property at 145 Portland Street is valued for its association with the local builder/speculator, Francis Phillips, who built the subject property along with the heritage properties directly to the south at 139, 141 and 143 Portland Street.
Contextually, the house-form building at 145 Portland Street is valued for its role in defining, supporting and maintaining the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, reflecting its evolution from a 19th-century residential and institutional enclave and Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing centre in the 20th century, to its current status as a mixed-use community. The house at 145 Portland Street is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting in the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it is among the small group of surviving late-19th century residential buildings, including the adjacent examples at 139, 139-143 Portland Street and 124-130 Portland on the west side of the street, all of which are also included on the City's Heritage Register.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the building at 145 Portland Street are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of the street between Adelaide and Portland streets
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey rectangular shaped plan
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross-gable roof covering the building, where a central gable is shared on the west slope with the attached property to the south, containing brackets and decorative wood bargeboard
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding (currently painted), the contrasting buff brick detailing for the string course beneath the west rooflines and on the window openings, and the stone and wood trim
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation, which is designed as a mirror image of the attached property to the south, with the main entrances placed side-by-side in segmental-arched surrounds with transoms (the open porch is not original)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west elevation, the single-storey bay window with the segmental-arched openings and the roof, the segmental-arched window openings in the second storey, the single round-arched attic opening under the central cross-gable, and the brick segmental arches and stone sills
Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of this notice which is December 13, 2019.

96 Spadina Avenue
Reasons for Designation
Darling Building
The property at 96 Spadina Avenue (including the entrance addresses at 100 and104 Spadina) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 96 Spadina Avenue is located on the southwest corner of Adelaide Street West in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and contains an 8-storey warehouse that was constructed in 1907 according to the designs of Toronto architects Gordon and Helliwell.&nbsp; Andrew Darling commissioned the Darling Building for his women&rsquo;s apparel company and offered the remaining space to tenants identified with the printing, lithography and clothing trades, as well as the supply warehouse for the Tamblyn&rsquo;s drugstore chain.&nbsp; Following Darling&rsquo;s untimely death in 1910, his executors retained the property and subsequent occupants included the Robert Darling and Company&rsquo;s woollens business.
The property at 96 Spadina Avenue was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 96 Spadina Avenue as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 96 Spadina Avenue has design value as a well-crafted early-20th century warehouse in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; The design of the Darling Building is particularly distinguished as an early example in Toronto of the Kahn system for reinforced concrete construction and stands out with its exposed concrete cladding and the Gothic-inspired crenellations on two corners of the roof.
The cultural heritage value of 96 Spadina Avenue is also through its role in the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 1900s when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new industrial centre following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; During the first half of the 20th century, the Darling Building contributed to Toronto's economic prosperity as part of the new collection of warehouses in the manufacturing district, replacing earlier residential and commercial buildings at the southwest corner of Spadina and Adelaide.
The Darling Building is also valued for its historical association with the Toronto architects Gordon and Helliwell.&nbsp; In a partnership that began in 1879 and lasted for five decades, Henry Bauld Gordon and Grant Helliwell completed projects for a variety of building types, but with a particular focus on churches and buildings sponsored by religious organizations (including YMCAs and the Upper Canada Bible and Tract Society) that reflected Gordon&rsquo;s participation in missions in China and Korea.&nbsp; The Darling Building was the firm&rsquo;s first documented commission in King-Spadina.
Contextually, the value of the property at 96 Spadina Avenue is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Darling Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting anchoring the southwest corner of Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street West where it is adjoined to the south and west by warehouses (1905 and 1912) associated with the W. J. Gage Publishing Company, while the landmark Tower Building (1927) and Balfour Building (1930) were recognized on the City's Heritage Register in the 1980s and mark two other corners of this important intersection in King-Spadina.&nbsp; With the neighbouring warehouse and commercial building at 379 and 383 Adelaide Street West, the Darling Building forms a trio of recognized heritage buildings that reflect the evolution of King-Spadina.
Heritage Attributes
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heritage attributes of the Darling Building at 96 Spadina Avenue are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street West
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the eight-storey building above the raised base with the flat-headed openings
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the concrete construction, cladding and detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the concrete crenellations and banding at the northeast and southeast corners
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and north elevations facing Spadina Avenue and Adelaide Street West, respectively, which are organized into five bays by piers that are banded in the base and the first (ground) floor
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat-headed openings on the east and north elevations, which are wider in the centre three bays (the original entrance on the east elevation was relocated from the southernmost bay)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The west side and rear (south) elevations, which are viewed from Adelaide Street West and Spadina Avenue, respectively, and feature symmetrically placed flat-headed openings that are separated by regularly spaced bays
The fire escapes on the north elevation are not identified as heritage attributes.
379 Adelaide Street West
Reasons for Designation
Gage Building
The property at 379 Adelaide Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 379 Adelaide Street West is located on the south side of the street, west of Spadina Avenue in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and contains a five-storey warehouse that was constructed in 1912 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Burke, Horwood and White.&nbsp; William J. Gage, founder of W. J. Gage and Company, commissioned the subject building for his subsidiary, the Educational Book Company.&nbsp; The site was chosen for its proximity to Gage's earlier warehouse (1905) at 82 Spadina Avenue, directly south of Adelaide, with the two properties adjoined at the rear where the buildings were linked.
The property at 379 Adelaide Street West was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 379 Adelaide Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 379 Adelaide Street West has design value as a well-crafted early-20th century warehouse in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which is distinguished by the classical organization of the principal (north) elevation with the decorative terra cotta detailing and the segmental-arched pediments that reflect the popular Edwardian Classical styling of the era.
The cultural heritage value of the property at 379 Adelaide Street West is also through its role in the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 1900s when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new industrial centre following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; During the first half of the 20th century, the Gage Building contributed to Toronto's economic prosperity as part of the new collection of warehouses in the manufacturing district, replacing earlier house form buildings on Adelaide Street West.
The associative value of the property at 379 Adelaide Street West is also through its connection to businessman and philanthropist, Sir William J. Gage, who commissioned the building.&nbsp; Founder of the W. J. Gage and Company that was noted for its publication of school textbooks and other educational supplies, Gage was a noted benefactor who received a knighthood in 1918 for his roles in fighting tuberculosis as a co-founder of the National Sanitarium Association and the financier of hospitals and other treatment facilities.&nbsp; Gage was also recognized as the founder of the Ina Grafton Homes Corporation, with the original mandate to accommodate widows and orphans after World War I.&nbsp; In 1938, the federal government commemorated Sir William J. Gage as a National Historic Person.
The Gage Building is associated with the Toronto architectural partnership of Burke, Horwood and White, which designed many landmark buildings in the city. The firm was headed by Edmund Burke, who had trained and then worked with his uncle, the celebrated Toronto architect, Henry Langley.&nbsp; After becoming a solo practitioner in 1892, Burke accepted the important commission for the Robert Simpson Department Store, noted as the first Chicago-style building in Canada, which was destroyed by fire immediately following its completion.&nbsp; In 1894, Burke's former apprentice, J. C. B. Horwood, returned from New York City to join the practice, which began with the firm's reconstruction of Simpson's complex.&nbsp; The addition in 1907 of Murray White, another former student who had gained further experience in Chicago, was reflected in projects for the Pilkington Glass Company (the recognized heritage complex on Mercer Street) and the subject building.
Contextually, the value of the property at 379 Adelaide Street West is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Gage Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Adelaide Street West near Spadina Avenue where it is adjoined to the southwest by the W. J. Gage Building (1905) at 82 Spadina (to which it is also historically related), the Darling Building (1907) to the east at 96 Spadina and the Lorne Building (1945) to the west at 383 Adelaide.&nbsp; The Gage Building is part of the group of recognized heritage buildings that anchors the southwest corner of Spadina and Adelaide.

&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heritage attributes of the Gage Building at 379 Adelaide Street West are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the south side of Adelaide Street West, west of Spadina Avenue
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the building with the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan, which has basement window openings on the principal (north) elevation&nbsp;

383 Adelaide Street West
Reasons for Designation
Lorne Building
The property at 383 Adelaide Street West (including the entrance address at 385 Adelaide) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 383 Adelaide Street West is located on the south side of the street, west of Spadina Avenue in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and contains a two-storey commercial building that was completed in 1945 according to the designs of Toronto architect Benjamin Swartz.&nbsp; Known historically as the Lorne Building, it was originally owned by Samuel Hollinger, founder of Empire Textiles, who had previously commissioned the neighbouring Hollinger Building (1941) at 350 Adelaide Street West.
The property at 383 Adelaide Street West was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2017.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 383 Adelaide Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Lorne Building has design value as a well-crafted commercial building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which is distinguished by its Art Moderne styling, particularly its diminutive scale, restrained brick and stone detailing, and distinctive signage.&nbsp; It complements in style and vintage the neighbouring Hollinger Building at 350 Adelaide Street West.
The cultural heritage value of the property at 383 Adelaide Street West is also through its role in the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 1900s when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new industrial centre following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; With its location in the manufacturing district that contributed to Toronto's economic prosperity, the Lorne Building was part of the ongoing development of King-Spadina during the interwar and World War II eras when properties with remaining late-19th century housing stock were redeveloped with modest commercial buildings adjoining the earlier large-scale warehouses.
The Lorne Building is also valued for its historical association with Toronto architect Benjamin Swartz, who is best known as the designer of several landmark buildings associated with the Jewish community, among them the Kiever Synagogue (also known as the First Russian Synagogue) in Kensington Market in 1927, followed by the first Mount Sinai Hospital (for which he modified an existing Yorkville building that survives in altered form).&nbsp; Beginning in the 1930s, Swartz's design aesthetic turned to the Art Moderne, as exemplified by the Pylon Theatre on College Street and the Hollinger and Lorne Buildings on Adelaide Street West.
Contextually, the value of the property at 383 Adelaide Street West is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it continued to evolve during the interwar and World War II eras when smaller commercial buildings were introduced, with most accommodating the garment trade that maintained its presence in the area.&nbsp; The Lorne Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Adelaide Street West near Spadina Avenue where it is the westernmost of a trio of recognized heritage buildings, with the Darling Building (1907) at the southwest corner of the intersection and the neighbouring Gage Building (1912) at 379 Adelaide Street West.
Heritage Attributes
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heritage attributes of the Lorne Building at 383 Adelaide Street West are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the south side of Adelaide Street West, west of Spadina Avenue
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the building with the two-storey rectangular-shaped plan
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the buff brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the shaped parapet with the stone coping at the north end and, beneath, the vintage sign reading ""Lorne Building""
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation, with the incised stone lintel and piers in the first (ground) floor (where the openings have been altered)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north elevation, the contrasting brick&nbsp; and stone band courses in the second storey where the pair of flat-headed window openings have stone sills
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewed from Adelaide Street, the east and west side elevations with the flat-headed window openings (the first-storey windows on the west side elevation are concealed by the neighbouring building)

-&nbsp; increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers; -&nbsp; increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees; As shown in Appendix A https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-139949.pdf, the recommended increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective January 1, 2020, are as follows:
-&nbsp; for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate &nbsp;and the Block 2 Rate by 3.0%; and-&nbsp; for flat rate consumers, all rates by 3.0%.&nbsp;The proposed increases to water and wastewater service fees, effective January 1, 2020, are shown in Appendix B http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-139950.pdf
City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.
The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, are set out in the report to the Budget Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and the General Manager, Toronto Water entitled ""2020 Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees "" (the ""Report"").
The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2020 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.390 billion, which is fully funded from the 2020 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services. The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 167 Queen Street East (including the entrance address at 169 Queen Street East and representing two of ten properties in the Thomas J. Wilkie block), is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located at the south-east corner of Queen Street East and George Street, the property at 167 Queen Street East (including the entry address at 169 Queen Street East) represents two of the original ten properties in the ten-unit block known as 167-185 Queen Street East constructed in 1886-7 for Thomas J. Wilkie.&nbsp; The three-storey brick-clad block contained commercial space at the ground floor level and residential accommodation above.
The property is located in the King- Parliament Secondary Plan Area and was one of the properties identified as having heritage potential in the King-Parliament Secondary Plan Review &ndash; Proposed Secondary Plan which was adopted without amendment by the Toronto and East York Council on October 10, 2019 and by City Council on October 29, 2019.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Thomas J. Wilkie block is representative of a late-19th century commercial and residential block in the High Victorian style with elements of the Richardsonian Romanesque style.&nbsp; The High Victorian style is chiefly characterized by variety and richness of detail and is evident in the plan of the building with its differently sized shop units, in the massing which originally included a corner tower and in the combination of materials, window types and the sculptural relief of surfaces seen in the brick relief moulding, wood shopfronts and cornices, pierced wood headers - all of which indicate a high degree of originality and craftsmanship.&nbsp; The Richardsonian Romanesque elements are present in the original corner tower elements, especially in the large arched openings.
The Wilkie block has historic value for its association with Thomas J. Wilkie (d.1916) who is renowned for his leadership of YMCA in Toronto and ultimately throughout the United States and Canada, and who, with his brother John N. Wilkie, contributed to the development of Long Branch as a summer resort which has since become a vibrant lake-front community.&nbsp;
The Wilkie block is valued as it represents the late-19th century community which developed around this section of Queen Street, as an urban townscape combining industrial, commercial and residential functions, lining one of the city's major cross-routes. It is valued for its historic association with Queen Street, the original boundary between the Town of York and the Park Lots estates to the north, with George Street, one of the original streets of the ten-block Town of York established in 1793, and for its association with the history and development of the King-Parliament neighbourhood in the late 19th century.
Contextually, this three-storey, High Victorian, brick commercial block maintains the scale, form and massing, materiality and patterns of use of this section of Queen Street East, particularly between Mutual Street and Seaton Street. Located on the north edge of the King-Parliament Secondary Plan Area which contains the historic 1793 Town of York, it supports the character of the area as it represents the late 19th century development of the neighbourhood with commercial, residential and industrial buildings and consistent urban street walls.&nbsp; Situated at the south-east intersection of Queen Street, (originally known as Lot Street), which separated the town to the south from park lot estates to the north, and George Street which was the western boundary of the original Town, the properties are physically, visually and historically linked to their surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 167 Queen Street East (including the entry address at 169 Queen Street East) are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the mixed-use commercial block at the south-east corner of Queen Street East and George Street
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials including the brick, stone and precast stone elements and wood
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the shop front, on the north and west elevations, the wood cornice and entablature with its dentil course and moulded corner element above the column and the projecting metal cornice
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window openings on both the north and west elevations which are flat-headed supporting stone lintels&nbsp; flanked by brick pilasters or arched with pre-cast keystones and stone imposts
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick moulding and decorative elements seen in the pilasters, corbelling, string courses at the tops of pilasters and over arched window heads on both the north and west elevation
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brick and stone belt courses
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cornice at the top of the building

1463,Notice of Intention to Designate - 445 Adelaide Street West (John P. Jackson House),"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and 445 Adelaide Street West, City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2019-12-24 05:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council stated its intention to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 445 Adelaide Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
John P. Jackson House
Reasons for Designation
The property at 445 Adelaide Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 445 Adelaide Street West is located on the southwest corner of Adelaide and Morrison streets in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; It contains a detached house form building that was completed in 1880 for realtor John P. Jackson and first occupied by Herbert Hamilton, a veterinary surgeon.&nbsp; Jackson also owned the adjacent properties to the west where his sister, Eliza Jackson Lennox commissioned the extant row houses (1904) at 447-453 Adelaide Street West.
The property at 445 Adelaide Street West was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in December 2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 445 Adelaide Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Significance
The John P. Jackson House has cultural heritage value for its design as one of the few surviving examples of a detached Toronto Bay-n-Gable house in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which displays the prototypical bay window beneath a gable with wood detailing and is further distinguished by its pattern brickwork.&nbsp; It is part of a small collection of extant residential buildings from the 19th and early 20th century in King-Spadina.&nbsp;
The property at 445 Adelaide Street West is valued historically for its contribution to the understanding of the development, evolution and regeneration of the King-Spadina neighbourhood from its origins as military land that was conveyed to the City of Toronto and stood opposite the municipality&rsquo;s &ldquo;West Market&rdquo; (renamed St. Andrew&rsquo;s Market and later replaced by St. Andrew's Playground and the adjoining City Waterworks Building).&nbsp; When the City sold the subject site to realtor John P. Jackson in the late 1800s, it was developed during the residential growth of King-Spadina prior to the area&rsquo;s transformation to a manufacturing district in the 20th century.&nbsp; Historically linked to the adjoining group of row houses at 447-453 Adelaide Street West (1904), which were commissioned by Jackson's sister, the John P. Jackson House is an important surviving reminder the late-19th century residential appearance of this area.
Contextually, the property at 445 Adelaide Street West has value through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it was initially developed as a residential and institutional enclave before the transformation of the area as an industrial district after the Great Fire of 1904. The John P. Jackson House is historically, visually and physically related to its surroundings adjoining the southwest corner of Adelaide and Morrison streets, beside the Eliza Lennox Houses (1904) at 447-453 Adelaide Street West and opposite St. Andrew&rsquo;s Playground.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the John P. Jackson House on the property at 445 Adelaide Street West are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of Morrison Street
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan and the raised base with the flat-headed window openings
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the red and buff brick and stone detailing on the principal (north) and east side elevations, including the quoins (most of the brickwork on the north elevation has been painted)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gable roof with the returned eaves (east) and the gable on the north elevation with the carved wood bargeboard
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation, which is organized into two bays with the main entrance in the first (ground) storey of the right (west) bay where it is set in a segmental-arched surround with a transom and a brick hood mould
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the north elevation, with the single-storey bay window with the segmental-arched openings in the first storey, the pair of segmental-arched openings with the brick hood moulds in the second storey, and the round-arched opening with the brick hood mould in the attic storey (the flat-headed opening in the second storey above the entrance is an alteration following the removal of the two-storey porch that is documented in archival images)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east (side) elevation with the segmental-arched window openings with the hood moulds in the first, second and attic stories

Eliza Lennox Houses
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 447-453&nbsp; Adelaide Street West are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The properties at 447-453 Adelaide Street West are located on the south side of the street, west of Morrison Street in King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; They contain a group of four row houses that were constructed in 1904 for Eliza Jackson Lennox, whose brother, John P. Jackson commissioned the adjoining detached house form building at 445 Adelaide Street West.&nbsp; By the mid-20th century, commercial uses were introduced to parts of the sites.
The properties at 447-453 Adelaide Street West were listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in December 2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 445-453 Adelaide Street West as contributing heritage properties.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Significance
The Eliza Lennox Houses have cultural heritage value for their design as a surviving group of row houses in the King-Spadina neighbourhood that are distinguished from earlier examples in the district with the Edwardian Classical styling.&nbsp; As a group, the row houses have distinctive detailing with, on the principal (north) elevations, the brick parapet that extends across all four units and incorporates a central segmental-arched pediment and terra cotta panels in the centre and on the ends.
The associative value of the Eliza Lennox Houses at 447-453 Adelaide Street West is through their contribution to an understanding of the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where they occupy former military reserve lands that were granted to the City of Toronto and located opposite the municipality&rsquo;s West Market site (renamed St. Andrew&rsquo;s Market and later replaced by St. Andrew&rsquo;s Playground and the adjoining City Waterworks complex).&nbsp;&nbsp; Linked historically to the adjoining John P. Jackson House (1880) at 445 Adelaide Street West, which was commissioned by Eliza Lennox's brother, subject properties are part of an important surviving collection of house form buildings in King-Spadina and, with their construction in 1904, reflect the period when the neighbourhood was undergoing a major transformation from a residential and institutional enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.
Contextually, the properties at 447-453 Adelaide Street West have value through their support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it initially developed as a residential and institutional enclave before the transformation of the area as an industrial district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Eliza Lennox Houses are historically, visually and physically related to their surroundings adjoining the southwest corner of Adelaide and Morrison streets, beside the John P. Jackson House (1880) at 445 Adelaide Street West and opposite St. Andrew&rsquo;s Playground.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Eliza Lennox Houses on the properties at 447-453 Adelaide Street West are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the group of row houses on the south side of the street, west of Morrison Street
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the group of two-storey buildings with the rectangular-shaped plans
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The raised bases with the stone cladding and the segmental-arched window openings with the brick flat arches
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and, on the principal north elevations of the group of row houses, the brick, stone and terra cotta detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofs and, across the north elevations of the group of row houses, the continuous stepped parapet with the stone coping that incorporates the central segmental-arched pediment and, in the centre and on the ends, the terra cotta panels
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevations of the group of row houses, where the units at 447-449 and 451-453 are designed as mirror images with the raised entrances placed side-by-side in the first (ground) floor in segmental-arched surrounds with brick detailing and panelled wood doors with glass inserts
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north elevations of the group of row houses, the fenestration with the segmental-arched openings with the brick flat arches and stone sills, with the individual openings placed beside the entrance in the first (ground) storey of each building and in pairs in the second storey
The east (side) elevation of 447 Adelaide Street West adjoins the neighbouring building at 445 Adelaide Street West.&nbsp; The west (side) elevation of 453 Adelaide Street West, which is partially concealed by the adjoining building, is devoid of openings.&nbsp; No heritage attributes are identified on the south (rear) elevations or additions.

1487,Notice of Intention to Designate - 90 Croatia Street (980 Dufferin Street) ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and 90 Croatia Street (980 Dufferin Street), City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2020-01-08 05:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 90 Croatia Street (980 Dufferin Street) under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
Kent School
The property at 90 Croatia Street (with the entrance address at 980 Dufferin Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 90 Croatia Street (with the entrance address at 980 Dufferin Street) is located on the southwest corner of Bloor Street West and Dufferin Street in the Toronto neighbourhood of Brockton.&nbsp; It contains the Kent School, a three-storey institutional building that was commissioned in 1907 by the Toronto Board of Education as the largest public school in Toronto to serve the rapidly growing west end of the city.&nbsp; Named for the Board&rsquo;s co-chair and one of its longest serving trustees, Herbert A. E. Kent, the first eight rooms of the school opened in 1908, with the remainder completed the next year.&nbsp; Following the growth of the school population after World War II, the south wing was added in 1960.&nbsp; The Kent School was declared surplus by the Toronto District School Board in 2016.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Kent School has design value as a well-crafted school building with Edwardian Classical styling.&nbsp; It was one of the first schools completed according to the Ogden Plan, created by the Toronto Board of Education&rsquo;s Buildings Department to improve health and safety in new facilities, including egress, lighting and ventilation.&nbsp; The Kent School features the T-shaped plan with the multiple entrances and oversized openings associated with the Ogden Plan in a design highlighted by classical detailing that remains on the main (east) and north (side) elevations.
The property at 90 Croatia Street (with the entrance address at 980 Dufferin Street) is historically associated with the development and expansion of Brockton, which was incorporated as a village and town before 1884 when it became one of the first independent municipalities to be annexed by the City of Toronto.&nbsp; At the west end of the rapidly expanding city, Brockton was the focus of immigration and residential development in the early 1900s, leading to the need for new educational facilities, including the Kent School.
As an institution of significance in Brockton, the Kent School was originally designed as the largest custom-built public school in Toronto to meet the demand for educational facilities that accompanied the increase in immigration and the westward growth of the city after the turn of the 20th century.&nbsp; In response to another population surge following World War II, the south wing was added to the Kent School as it continued to serve the Brockton community.
The Kent School is linked historically to architect C. H. Bishop through his role as Superintendent of Buildings for the Toronto Board of Education during the period when the school was designed and constructed.&nbsp; Bishop is credited with dozens of elementary and secondary schools in Toronto during his thirty-year career and, to address the demand for new and larger schools in the early 20th century, developed standardized plans for the Board of Education with features that were considered innovative at the time.
Contextually, the property at 90 Croatia Street helped define the historical context of Brockton where it remains historically, physically and visually linked to its setting on the southwest corner of Bloor Street West and Dufferin Street, a major intersection in Toronto.&nbsp; With its scale, design and orientation facing Dufferin Street, The Kent School is highly visible and a local landmark in Brockton.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Kent School at 90 Croatia Street (with the entrance address of 980 Dufferin Street) are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the west side of Dufferin Street, south of Bloor Street

Reasons for Designation
Edward Green Building
The property at 38 Camden Street (including the entrance address at 40 Camden Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 38 Camden Street is located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Brant Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; It contains a commercial building that was completed in 1952 for Edward Green according to the plans of Toronto architect E. I. Richmond.
The property at 38 Camden Street was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in December 2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 38 Camden Street as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;
Statement of Significance
The Edward Green Building has cultural heritage value for its design as a Mid-Century Modern factory and warehouse that is part of a surviving collection of post-World War II commercial buildings on Camden Street.&nbsp; The subject building is distinguished by the treatment of its principal (south) elevation facing Camden Street with vertical and horizontal elements, including the frontispiece with the narrow vertical window opening and the recessed window openings in the flanking bays.&nbsp;
The property at 38 Camden Street is valued historically for its contribution to the development, evolution and regeneration of the King-Spadina neighbourhood during the 20th century.&nbsp; After the Great Fire of 1904, the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district.&nbsp; Following World War II when many manufacturers left King-Spadina for the city&rsquo;s suburbs, portions of the community were redeveloped with low-rise commercial buildings, including the Edward Green Building and its surviving neighbours on Camden Street.
The Edward Green Building was designed by architect E. I. (Edward Isaac) Richmond (1908-1982) who, after opening a solo practice in the late 1930s, &ldquo;employed a progressive modernist style in his early commissions&rdquo; while designing, extending and altering residential and commercial buildings in Toronto.&nbsp; During the post-World War II era when he became &ldquo;one of the most prolific designers of apartment towers in Toronto,&rdquo; Richmond also designed low-rise factories and warehouses in King-Spadina, including the subject building (quotations from Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada, 1800-1950).
Contextually, the property at 38 Camden Street has value through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; The Edward Green Building is part of an important collection of buildings that represent the evolution of King-Spadina from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave in the 19th century, to its redevelopment as the City&rsquo;s new manufacturing centre in the early 20th century, and its transformation after World War II with low-rise commercial edifices.&nbsp; The Edward Green Building is also historically and visually linked to its setting on the north side of Camden Street between Spadina Avenue and Brant Street where it is part of an enclave of surviving mid-20th century commercial buildings that are recognized on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Edward Green Building on the property at 38 Camden Street are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the north side of the street
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan and the raised base with the flat-headed window openings
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing on the principal (south) elevation
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the minimal cornice on the south end, which wraps around the ends of the east and west side elevations
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into five bays by brick piers
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, the frontispiece in the central bay with the main entrance in the first (ground) floor and the vertical flat-headed window opening above
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjoining the frontispiece, the flat-headed window openings in the first and second stories with the stone sills, the panelled wood aprons, and the brickwork above the second-storey openings
&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations where, in the southernmost bays, the brickwork and coping is extended from the south elevation

Reasons for Designation
Essery Row (Part Of)
The properties at 61-69 Niagara Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the south side of the street west of Bathurst Street and adjacent to the mid-19th century heritage property at 89-109 Niagara Street in the South Niagara District neighbourhood, the properties at 61-69 Niagara Street contain five two-storey Late Victorian-era row houses completed in 1885 by original owner William H. Essery, and first occupied by working class families. The subject properties are part of a larger set of seventeen row houses built together by the Essery family at 55-87 Niagara Street. Two of these (75 and 77 Niagara Street) were demolished in 1963 to accommodate a public laneway. While their loss interrupts the original contiguous row, the overall integrity of the historic row is not negatively impacted. In August 2014, City Council adopted the South Niagara Planning Strategy, which includes a Heritage Study identifying the subject properties as having potential cultural heritage value for their contribution to defining, supporting and maintaining the late 19th-century character of the area.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The properties at 61-69 Niagara Street are valued for their design as part of an intact set of fifteen remaining 2-storey Victorian-era row houses constructed together in 1885-1886 and representative of the rise of speculative development in downtown Toronto in the late-nineteenth century to meet the housing demands of a burgeoning population. With their polychromatic brickwork, shared scale, and organization of the principal (north) elevations, these paired and mirrored row houses are unified by the rhythm of the placement of their window and door openings.&nbsp;
The subject properties are also valued for their association with the Essery family, who owned and developed nearly the entire portion of the south side of Niagara Street between Bathurst and Tecumseth over the course of the 1880s. After establishing The Essery Manufacturing Company on the site of today&rsquo;s National Casket Company Factories heritage property at the west end of the block in the early 1880s, the local manufacturers and builders William H. and William L. Essery purchased the vacant lots at 55-87 Niagara Street on speculation and promptly sold them following development.&nbsp;
The Essery Row, including 61-69 Niagara Street, provides a consistent stretch of building fabric that is valued for its importance in defining, maintaining and supporting the historical character of the South Niagara District neighbourhood in the late-1800s as a largely working class residential community with larger scale industrial uses along its southern edge, including the adjacent National Casket Company Factories complex, which was also once the location of the Essery Manufacturing Company.
Comprising five two-storey row houses within the set of remaining fifteen dwellings built together, the properties at 61-69 Niagara Street are historically and visually linked to their setting along the northern edge of the CPR and GTR railway tracks, and within an area that has maintained a consistent built form, pattern of use and heritage character established more than 120 years ago.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of all five house-form buildings at 61-69 Niagara Street are:
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The location of the row houses on the south side of Niagara Street, including the set back and orientation
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the row houses including their two-storey height and L-shaped plan on a raised basement, and gable roof with each mirrored pair containing a central cross-gable on the principal (north) elevation
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mirrored organization of the principal (north) elevations with their side-by-side entrances, single-storey bay windows and symmetrically-arranged windows at the second floor level
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (north) elevations, the segmental-arched window and door openings
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials with the red brick cladding and buff brick detailing, the pointed buff brick headers above all openings, and the existing wooden window- and door-frames and sills
&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (north) elevations, the transom surmounting the main entrance

1603,Notice of Intention to Designate - 41 Wabash Avenue,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and 41 Wabash Avenue, City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2020-03-13 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 41 Wabash Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
The property at 41 Wabash Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design-physical, historical-associative and contextual value.
National Equipment Company Ltd
Description
Located on the south side of Wabash Avenue, east of Sorauren Avenue, the property at 41 Wabash Avenue is a two-and-a-half storey rectangular-plan, brick-clad volume constructed for the National Equipment Company Ltd. in 1912 in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The building, originally known as the National Equipment Company Ltd. and more recently known as J. S. Addison Plumbing, has physical and design value as a representative of an early twentieth-century, industrial warehouse typology.&nbsp; This is evident in its location on the north edge of the property with no set back, the simple block massing, brick cladding and regular distribution of window openings which is interrupted to accommodate functional requirements such as loading bays and entrances.&nbsp; Although an industrial form, the building has architectural refinement in the raising of the parapet into a broad pediment on its principal (north) elevation facing Wabash Avenue and in the arrangement of the window openings in a classical manner which features hierarchy and symmetry presented in the double width of the central window aligned with the pediment and flanked by two windows, half its width on either side at both upper levels.&nbsp;
The building has historic value as it is associated with the industrial development of area which was encouraged by location of the railways to the east of this section of the Roncesvalles neighbourhood.&nbsp; The purchase and development of the property at 41 Wabash Avenue in 1911 by the National Equipment Company followed several other industries which located between Sorauren Avenue and the railway line in the triangular area just south of Dundas Street West including the Canada Linseed Oil Mills Ltd on the north side of Wabash Avenue. These industries provided employment for the Roncesvalles neighbourhood to the west and south and to Brockton village to the east.
Contextually, with its century-old materials, composition and form, this industrial block has heritage value as it maintains the industrial character of this eastern section of the historic Roncesvalles neighbourhood. Located to the south-east of Dundas Street West and the railway lines, the neighbourhood has had a continuous mix of low-rise industrial and residential buildings for over 110 years.&nbsp; The addition of Sorauren Park and the smaller Charles G. Williams Park has added important amenity to the area which will be enhanced by the adaptive re-use of the Canada Linseed Oil building on the north side of Wabash Avenue as a community centre.&nbsp; The integration of heritage and its adaptive re-use will build on and enhance the richness and variety of the sense of place in this historic and evolving neighbourhood.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 41 Wabash Avenue are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the industrial warehouse building on the south side of Wabash Avenue&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half-storey building including the raised parapet with it gable form on the north elevation
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; The materials including the brick cladding, the stone lintels over the loading bays, the bush-hammered stone sills, the stone blocks set as the top masonry course beneath the top of the windows on the north elevation, and projecting wood window hoods over the second storey windows on the north elevation
&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; On the north elevation the arrangement of openings including the wide window openings flanked by two narrower windows at the upper levels, the door at grade and the adjacent opening presumably originally used for loading and now filled in with blocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; On the west elevation, at all three levels, the three pairs of long narrow window openings with segmental-arched headers towards the south end (one of the openings has been extended to floor level) and the loading dock opening at the lower level at the north end (filled in) with a single narrow, segmental-arched headed opening above at the upper level
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; The brick clad east elevation and remaining visible window openings
The rear, metal-clad, single-storey addition is not included in the heritage attributes.&nbsp; The south elevation is not included in the heritage attributes as it has been overclad in metal siding.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 13, 2020, which is April 14, 2020.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 305 King Street West (including the entrance addresses at 309 and 311 King Street West) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the south side of the street between John Street and Blue Jays Way, the property at 305 King Street West contains a two-storey commercial building that was completed in 1928.&nbsp; The King Building replaced part of a three-storey commercial row built in 1887. The current building is attributed to architect Thomas Elliott Muirhead in his position as staff architect for the John G. Kent Construction Company, which acquired the site in 1923.&nbsp; Five years later, Kent&rsquo;s estate sold the property to the King Investment Company under the direction of Myrtle Warren, and the initial tenants included the Carter Radio Company and the Utah Radio Products Company headed by the new owner.&nbsp; From 1930 until 1956, the property was owned by Harry V. Mallabar (sic), who expanded the subject building and acquired the neighbouring properties for his Malabar Costumes Company (now Malabar Limited).&nbsp; The property at 305 King Street West was identified as a contributing heritage property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District Plan, which was adopted by City Council in 2017 when the King Building was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Statement of Significance
The property at 305 King Street West has cultural heritage value as a representative example of an early 20th century commercial building with the symmetry and the cornice with brackets inspired by Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most typologies in the first quarter of the 20th century.&nbsp; Introduced to a streetscape that was originally developed with residential row houses (Hughes Terrace) in the 1850s, followed by commercial storefronts in the 1880s, the King Building was a compatible addition to the block in the 1920s with its setback, cladding and detailing.
The associative value of the King Building is through its contribution to the evolution of the King-Spadina community, which began in the 19th century as an institutional and residential enclave and was transformed after the Great Fire of 1900 into Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre.&nbsp; During the latter period, many of the original buildings were replaced with new edifices, including the subject site where part of a former commercial row became the location of the King Building.
The property at 305 King Street West is also valued for its historical association with John G. (Gowans) Kent, owner of the construction company that developed the site, and his staff architect Thomas Elliott Muirhead, to which its design is attributed.&nbsp; As the son of the founder of Gowans, Kent and Company, John G. Kent (1861-1927) worked for the noted Toronto glassware firm prior to establishing a construction company with his son, Henry (Harry) Gowans Kent in the early 1920s.&nbsp; Apart from his business interests, which included his role as president of the Toronto Board of Trade, Kent gained prominence as the managing director of the Canadian National Exhibition (1920-27) and, in that capacity, was the first Canadian to head the American Association of Fairs and Exhibitions.&nbsp; Thomas Elliott Muirhead (1890-1961) is best known for his role as the architect for the John G. Kent Construction Company.&nbsp; With few extant projects remaining in Toronto, the Kenson Apartments (1927) at 51 Grosvenor Street and the National Cast Register Company Building (1935) at 222 Lansdowne Avenue are other recognized heritage properties designed by Muirhead.
The King Building is also linked to Toronto&rsquo;s famed Malabar Costumes Company (now known as Malabar Limited), which acquired the property in 1930 and expanded and occupied the premises until 1956.&nbsp; Founded in Winnipeg in the early 20th century, Henry V. Mallabar (sic) opened the enterprise&rsquo;s Toronto branch in 1923 where the company manufactured and rented costumes to clients ranging from individuals to both amateur and professional companies across North America.&nbsp; In its King Street location, Malabar Limited unveiled its renowned opera department and, by 1950, described itself as &ldquo;the leading costume house in Canada, providing costumes for theatrical/musical productions and masquerade galas.&rdquo;
Contextually, the property at 305 King Street West supports the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it evolved from its origins in the 1800s as an institutional and residential enclave to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing century during the first half of the 20th century.&nbsp; The King Building contributes to the surviving collection of recognized heritage buildings from all phases of the development of King-Spadina.&nbsp; With its location on the south side of King Street between John Street and Blue Jays Way (originally Peter Street), the King Building is part of an important block that includes Hughes Terrace (former residential buildings dating to the 1850s), the Westinghouse Building (a warehouse constructed in two phases between 1927 and 1935), and a collection of late-19th century commercial buildings that are designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the King Building at 305 King Street West are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the south side of King Street West between John Street and Blue Jays Way
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The scale, form and massing of the two-storey rectangular-shaped plan
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and metal detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The flat roofline with the cornice with the corbelled brackets on the north elevation facing the street
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The principal (north) elevation where the first (ground) floor storefront has stone detailing (the openings have been altered)
&nbsp;&nbsp; - On the north elevation, the second storey with the three window openings (the centre opening is larger) with the stone sills and the brick flat archesNote: the east side elevation, which is viewed from King Street West, has flat-headed window openings.&nbsp; The west side elevation adjoins the neighbouring building at 315 King Street.&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation and wings are not identified as heritage attributes.Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 13, 2020, which is April 14, 2020.

Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Dundas Street East and Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood and directly across the street from St. Michael's Cathedral, the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is part of a group of three-storey Georgian style row houses that remain from the original ten-unit terrace completed in 1848. The current building at 195 Church Street was reconstructed in 1981 following the removal of the original structure due to fire in 1956. All four properties were included in the City of Toronto's inaugural list of properties added to the Inventory of Heritage Properties in 1973, including the then-vacant lot at 195 Church Street.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued as a rare example of urban row housing in Toronto completed before 1850. The Georgian styling, popular before the second half of the 19th century, signals some of the city&rsquo;s earliest buildings. While this type and style of building was once prevalent in downtown Toronto, the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued as a rare surviving example that is also considered to be the city's best preserved set of Georgian row houses.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued for its association with architect John Tully, who is attributed to the design. Tully is recognized as one of the first professional architects to work in Toronto, where only a small number of his commissions survive, including the nearby designated properties at 68-70 Shuter Street (Edward Cooper Houses). Like the Shuter Street properties, 195 and 197 Church Street were originally owned by local merchant and speculative developer, Edward Cooper.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it defines the remaining portion of the original ten-unit brick terrace and, more broadly, the mid-19th century residential character of Church Street and the surrounding area. Within the context of a neighbourhood in flux due to ongoing development pressure, the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued together as a group of row houses with historic, physical and visual links to its surroundings for over 170 years.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is highlighted by the current infill replacement building at 195 Church Street, constructed in 1981 as a compatible replacement that re-establishes the unity of the historic row.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the east side of the street between Shuter Street and Dundas Street East&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The scale, form and massing of the red brick terrace with its three storey height with pitched roofs, chimneys and corbelled brick firebreak end walls defining the individual properties
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The materials with the red and buff brick, and the brick, stone and wood detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The principal (west) elevations, which are symmetrically organized with entrances located in the left (north) bays and flat-headed window openings with stone lintels and sills in all three storeys
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The fenestration with the double-hung sash windows, including the six-over-six panes, where existing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The entries, which are recessed and have flat-headed door openings with transoms beneath stone lintels
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The decorative, polychrome brickwork with the buff brick stringcourses at all the levels, the vertical quoining delineating individual properties in the row and coffered panel brick frieze below the rooflines
195 Church Street
Reasons for Designation
The property at 195 Church Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Dundas Street East and Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood and directly across the street from St. Michael's Cathedral, the property at 195 Church Street is part of a group of four three-storey Georgian style row houses that remain from the original ten-unit terrace completed in 1848. The current building at 195 Church Street was reconstructed in 1981 by Mekinda, Snyder &amp; Weis Architects in a compatible manner to the rest of the surviving row, following the removal of the original structure in 1956. All four properties were included in the City of Toronto's inaugural list of properties added to the Inventory of Heritage Properties in 1973, including the then-vacant lot at 195 Church Street.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 195 Church Street is valued as a significant example of compatible urban infill within the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace which is valued as a rare example of urban row housing originally completed before 1850. The current replacement building at 195 Church Street (1981) represents the influence of prevailing heritage conservation theory in the latter half of the 20th century, when architects, preservationists and planners were exploring new ways of repairing lost or damaged urban fabric in order to re-establish the cultural significance of a site.
The principal (west) elevation refers to the historic row's Georgian styling, which was popular before the second half of the 19th century and signals some of Toronto's earliest buildings. This reinterpretation also respects the form, articulation and materiality of the rest of the row, and supports the prevailing streetscape character while incorporating identifiably contemporary interpretations of historic features, such as the corbelling above the first and third storey openings, the recessed entrance and third floor balcony, an at-grade second entrance and the omission of a cornice. These small design gestures make evident the contemporary date of construction in contrast to the rest of the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace, but do so without disrupting the pedestrian scale, rhythm of openings, prevailing materiality and articulation of the streetscape.
Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued as a rare surviving example of a collection of Georgian row houses, considered to be the city's best preserved set and highlighted by the current infill replacement building at 195 Church Street.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it defines the remaining portion of the original ten-unit brick terrace and, more broadly, the mid-19th century residential character of Church Street and the surrounding area.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 195 Church Street are:
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the east side of the street between Shuter Street and Dundas Street East
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The scale, form and massing of the red brick row house with its three storey height and flat roof
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The materials with the red brick, and the brick and stone detailing
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The principal (west) elevation, which is symmetrically organized with the recessed entrance located in the left (north) bay and flat-headed window openings
&nbsp;&nbsp; - The decorative brickwork with the corbelled headers above the openings oat the first and third storeys, and the coffered panel brick frieze below the roofline

Reasons for the Partial Repeal
City of Toronto By-law 969-2005 was enacted on November 24, 2005.&nbsp; The By-law designates the property at 158 Sterling Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Act.&nbsp; The property contains the heritage building known as the Northern Aluminum Company Building (the ""Heritage Building""). The legal description currently includes the neighbouring properties municipally known as 20 Perth Avenue and 150,150R and 164 Sterling Road.
The property at 158 Sterling Road was legally severed into three parcels: the first parcel identified as 158 Sterling Road; the second parcel identified as 150, 150R and 164 Sterling Road; and the third parcel as 20 Perth Avenue by notice of decision issued October 13, 2015 and June 15, 2016. Following the severances, the heritage designation remained on title for all three properties.

Amendment of Designating By-law
Nealon House
City of Toronto By-law 91-91 designating the property at 197 King Street East under Part IV, Section 29 of the Act is revised to update the cultural heritage values and attributes in accordance with the 2005 amendments to the Act.&nbsp; The property containing the building known historically as the Nealon House meets Ontario Regulation 9/06 of the Act, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the south side of the street between Frederick Street (east) and George Street (west), the property at 197 King Street East contains a four-storey commercial building that was constructed in 1888 as a hotel named the Nealon House after its owner, grocer James Nealon.&nbsp; Following Nealon&rsquo;s untimely death, the property was acquired in 1890 by Daniel and John Kennedy, who continued to operate the hotel.&nbsp; The property remained in continuous use as a hotel and a tavern for nearly a century.&nbsp;
The property at 197 King Street East was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1984 and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1991 by By-law 91-91.&nbsp; The property is identified as a contributing heritage property in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District, which is under appeal in 2019.
Statement of Significance
The property at 197 King Street East has cultural heritage value for its design as a well-crafted late-19th century commercial building with decorative detailing inspired by the most popular architectural styles of the late Victorian era.&nbsp; The Nealon House draws upon the Romanesque Revival, Renaissance Revival and Italianate styles in a design that is distinguished by the decorative stone and brickwork, oversized bay window, elaborate cornice and distinctive corner tower.
The Nealon House is valued for its association with the development, evolution and significance of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood as it evolved from its origins as &ldquo;Old Town,&rdquo; survived the Great Fire of 1849 as the commercial and institutional heart of Toronto, and withstood the economic downturn of the area in the 20th century before it was revitalized in the 1960s.&nbsp; Located within the original boundaries of the Town of York on the community&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; where it replaced an earlier hotel and store, the Nealon House remained in continuous service as a hotel and a tavern for nearly a century.
Contextually, the property at 197 King Street East supports and maintains the historical character of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood as it evolved in the 19th and 20th century from its origins as the Town of York to a mixed-use community highlighted by institutional landmarks that include St. James&rsquo; Cathedral, St. Lawrence Hall and the St. Lawrence Market.&nbsp; The Nealon House is historically and visually linked to its setting within the original 10-block townsite established in 1793 and on Toronto&rsquo;s original &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; where it is part of the important collection of surviving 19th century commercial buildings on King Street East that are recognized on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.&nbsp; With its scale, vintage and decorative features, the Nealon House complements the Christie, Brown and Company Biscuit Factory (1874 with subsequent additions) at 200 King Street East, opposite, which was restored and adaptively reused as George Brown College&rsquo;s St. James Campus and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Nealon House at 197 King Street East are:
-&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the south side of King Street East between Frederick (east) and George (west) streets
-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey rectangular-shaped plan
-&nbsp; The brick cladding with the brick, stone, terra cotta, wood and metal detailing
-&nbsp; The roof, which is flat at the north end where the bracketed metal cornice marks the north end of the roof facing King Street East and the flat-roofed tower on the northwest corner has round-arched openings with decorative detailing (north and west) complementing the principal (north) elevation (the original lantern has been removed)
-&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation facing King Street East, which is organized into four bays by brick pilasters with brick and stone detailing (the pilasters have been altered in the first storey)
-&nbsp; On the north elevation, in the first (ground) storey, the main entrance, which is elevated in the second bay from the left (east) and contains a single wood door with glass inserts (the transom above the door and the adjoining storefront to the east and west have been altered), the secondary entrance in the left (east) bay with the wood door, and the open carriageway in the right (west) bay, which is flat-headed at the north end on King Street and round-arched at the south end
-&nbsp; In the upper three stories of the north elevation, the flat-headed window openings, including the oversized recessed bay window that extends across the centre two bays, with the stone lintels and sills, the round-arched tympana over the fourth-storey openings incorporating terra cotta detailing (excluding the opening in the left or east bay), the spandrels with the basketweave brickwork in the fourth storey, the panels with the corbelled and decorative brickwork beneath all of the window openings, and the terra cotta panel with the caricature above the window opening in the fourth storey, left or east bay (some of the openings contain original wood windows)
-&nbsp; On the rear (south) elevation, which is accessed through the carriageway, the round-arched window opening in the first storey (the east half of the south elevation is covered by the four-storey south wing)
The east and west side elevations are concealed by the neighbouring buildings, apart from the fourth storey with the remnants of painted signage.&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation of the main building (apart from the first-storey round-arched opening) and the west and south elevations of the south wing have round-arched and flat-headed openings, some of which have been altered.

To impose regulations requiring physical distancing within Parks and Public Squares.&nbsp;
WHEREAS under sections 7 and 8 of the City of Toronto Act, 2006 the City has broad authority to provide any service or thing the City considers necessary or desirable for the public and to pass by-laws in respect of the health, safety and well-being of persons and the economic, social and environmental well-being of the City; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS City Council has enacted Chapter 59, Emergency Management, of the City of Toronto Municipal Code (""Chapter 59"") with respect to numerous matters concerning the City's response to a situation or an impending situation that constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons or substantial damage to property and that is caused by the forces of nature, a disease, an accident or other health risk or an act whether intentional or otherwise; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS under the specific powers and restrictions respecting delegation in sections 20 to 24, the City may delegate its powers and duties under the Act to an officer or employee of the City, as provided in section 21; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS under section 59-6.1.A. of Chapter 59, City Council delegated its statutory authority under the City of Toronto Act, 2006, and under any other legislation, to the Mayor, exclusively for use in emergencies, subject to the specific restrictions and conditions imposed by Chapter 59, the Act, and otherwise; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS COVID-19 is present within the City of Toronto, and COVID-19 is a disease that is readily communicable from person to person, carries a risk of serious complications such as pneumonia or kidney failure, and may result in death; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS the spread of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS, on March 17, 2020, an emergency was declared, by means of Order in Council 518/2020 for purposes of s.7.1 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, due to the health risks to Ontario residents arising from COVID-19; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS, on March 23, 2020 an emergency was declared by the head of council of the City of Toronto for purposes of s.4 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, and s.59-5.1 of Chapter 59 due to the risk to the health of the residents of the City of Toronto arising from spread of COVID-19 and its presence within the City of Toronto (the ""Emergency""); and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS this order is based on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, who has recommended physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including maintaining a distance of at least two metres from other individuals who are not members of the same household; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS in accordance with section 59-6.1.B. of Chapter 59, I believe that it is necessary to utilize the delegated authority to make the following order to address the Emergency in a timely manner, and that the exercise of the delegated authority is a reasonable basis to alleviate harm or damage as a reasonable alternative to other measures to address the Emergency for the following reasons: due to the fact that COVID-19 is a disease that is readily communicable from person to person and that time is of the essence in implementing measures to address the spread of COVID-19, which makes implementation of these measures through other means impractical in the circumstances; and
&nbsp;
WHEREAS the City currently regulates and prohibits specific conduct on City property such as parks, and public squares, which is undesirable, constitutes a nuisance, or presents health risks to other residents of the City of Toronto, it is my opinion that the harm caused by COVID-19 will be alleviated by adding to the list of prohibited conduct in these areas, a failure to maintain a distance of two metres from other individuals who are not members of their same household, which shall be enforceable in the same manner as other currently prohibited conduct.
&nbsp;
Therefore, I, John Tory, Mayor of the CITY OF TORONTO, enact by issuing of this Order, the following regulations with respect to the City of Toronto:
&nbsp;
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter 608, Parks, of the City of Toronto Municipal Code is amended to require compliance with physical distancing guidelines by:

1791,Notice of Intention to Designate - 582 King Street West ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and 582 King Street West, City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2020-09-14 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 582 King Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 582 King Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp; The property was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Inventory in 2005 and identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District Plan (2017) currently under appeal.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 582 King Street West (including the entrance addresses at 590 and 592 King Street West and 471 and 473 Adelaide Street West) extends from the north side of King Street West to the south side of Adelaide Street West in the block east of Portland Street. The property contains a collection of two four-storey factory-type buildings at 582-592 King Street West and one four-storey factory-type building and two-storey wing at 473 Adelaide Street West - all completed in 1902-1911 and commissioned by Canadian Kodak Company Ltd., to the designs of architects Chadwick &amp; Beckett and F. A. Fifield.&nbsp; A single-storey garage facing Adelaide Street West, designed by Kaplan &amp; Sprachman architects, was added to the property in 1928-31 by Ontario Silknit Ltd.&nbsp;
Canadian Kodak Company Ltd. purchased and occupied the property from 1902 until 1917, after which it was occupied by a variety of tenants including the Toronto Terminal Warehouse, later known as the Canadian Rail and Harbour Terminals.&nbsp; Ontario Silknit Ltd. purchased the property in 1927 and occupied the premises for over 60 years with a variety of garment industry-related businesses.&nbsp;
The property at 582 King Street contains four buildings as follows:
588-592 King Street West, (original address, now the western half of the complex on King Street known as 590 King Street West), four-storey building constructed in 1902.
582-586 King Street West, (original address, now the eastern half of the complex on King Street known as 590 King Street West), four-storey building constructed in 1904.
473 Adelaide Street West, a four-storey building with a two-storey wing constructed in 1909-10.&nbsp; The four-storey section of this building bridges across a laneway at the second to fourth floor levels to connect with the rear of the western half of the King Street buildings.&nbsp;
471 Adelaide Street West, a single-storey garage building constructed in 1928-1931 by Ontario Silknit Ltd.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 582 King Street West contains a complex of buildings which have design and physical value as representatives of well-crafted, early 20th-century factory buildings. The long rectangular plans of the three four-storey buildings and two-storey wing, with brick cladding, and regularly spaced window openings expressive of the internal post and beam structure and factory function, are characteristic features of the factory building type.&nbsp; Elements of the Edwardian Classical style are evident in the brick and stone detailing and the hierarchy and symmetry of the arrangement of openings of the principal south elevations of 582-592 King Street.&nbsp; Further design value is present in the garage with its Style Moderne characteristics seen in the stepped parapet and in the pilasters which terminate on the face of parapet.
The property has historical value through its potential to yield information about the development of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 1900s as an important industrial centre which contributed to Toronto's prosperity and provided employment for over 120 years. It has value through its direct association with the Canadian Kodak Company Ltd. which constructed its first purpose built retail and manufacturing complex on the property and occupied it for 15 years, expanding with new buildings as well new business products, increasing output and employment substantially in that short time. The complex has further associative and historic value as it was occupied for over 60 years by Ontario Silknit Ltd. whose garment manufacturing provided employment for generations as well as the ""Fashion District"" identity of the King Spadina neighbourhood The ""Lovable"" signage painted on the brick of the east elevation at 473 Adelaide Street West retains this identity and Silknit's lingerie manufacturing legacy.&nbsp;
The property has further associative value as it demonstrates the work of two Toronto-based architectural firms, Chadwick &amp; Beckett and Kaplan &amp; Sprachman.&nbsp; Chadwick &amp; Beckett (1893-1917) were a prolific firm with numerous commissions which included a wide variety of buildings types: the architects made a particular contribution to the design of industrial buildings across the City of Toronto in the first decade of the twentieth century. Kaplan &amp; Sprachman (c. 1926-1951) were nationally renowned for their designs of hundreds of movie theatres across the county in the 1930s and 1940s, frequently featuring the Style Moderne style. Their commissions included a variety of other building typologies including industrial buildings like the garage which features the Style Moderne.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Located to the east of Portland Street with prominent elevations on both King Street West and Adelaide Street West, the property of three, four-storey brick clad buildings with Edwardian Classical style details and the rear bridge over the laneway is important in defining the early 20th-century industrial character of the area as it maintains the scale, material qualities and design patterns of the factory structures.&nbsp; Built between 1902 and 1911, and having been a centre of enterprise and employment for almost 120 years, the factory complex is functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings and contributed to the identity of the King Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; The 473 Adelaide Street West building contributes to the street wall framing the view of St. Mary's Church (1885-1904) which terminates Adelaide Street West at Bathurst Street.

Little York Hotel Stables and Coach House
Reasons for Designation
The property at 65 George Street, containing the Little York Stables and Coach House, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp; The property was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Inventory in 1983 and identified as a contributing property in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District (2015) currently under appeal.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of George Street, just south of King Street East, the property at 65 George Street contains the stables and coach house building.&nbsp; It was constructed in 1880 as part of the adjacent Little York Hotel at 187 King Street East, located to the north of the subject property at the south-east corner of King Street East and George Street. The hotel and stables-coach house were part of the same property until they were severed into two lots in 1977.&nbsp; The stables and coach house originally contained a lower floor with stables and carriage storage with an upper level hay loft.&nbsp; Between 1885 and 1973 the second floor of the stables and coach house building was altered in various forms including additions to the second floor, but these additions and alterations were removed with further alterations and restoration in the 1980s.&nbsp;
The Little York Hotel was included on the City's first Heritage Inventory (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1973 and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1979.&nbsp; A Heritage Easement Agreement for the 187 King Street East property was registered on the property title in 1980.&nbsp; Restoration of the exterior of the hotel, which included removing the blue paint applied to the brick elevations, was begun in 1978.&nbsp;
The stables were listed on the City's Heritage Register in 1984.&nbsp; In 1983, restoration and renovation work began with the removal of the blue paint from the principal (west) elevation. The renovations, which included the reconstruction of the second storey elevation with five new windows and the raising and reconstruction of the parapet, were undertaken in 1988.&nbsp; The ground floor windows adjacent to the carriageway were restored, removing a doorway. The carriage way was given a recessed glazed entry and the northern-most ground floor window was lengthened to accommodate a secondary exit.&nbsp; The use of the building was changed to accommodate a retail store and offices.&nbsp; In 1993 the use was again changed to accommodate a public hall and offices. The former stables and coach-house are currently occupied as an art gallery.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The former 1880s Little York Hotel coach house and stables at 65 George Street is representative of a once common and now rare 19th century building type. Constructed as part of the Little York Hotel, the stables-coach house building retains the stylistic features of the complex in its details and in the original carriage way entrance.&nbsp; Although the upper floor represents a recent addition, it has been done in a sympathetic manner which reconstructed the original parapet and whose new windows have the segmental-arched openings of the adjacent second floor hotel windows.&nbsp; The lack of keystones in the window heads and the inclusion of a projecting brick course are consistent with good conservation practise of the time which required new additions to be distinct but complementary to the existing heritage building. The three arched ground floor windows to the north of the carriage entrance likely date from the late 1880s or early 1890s and, although not original, have been part of the complex for over 120 years.&nbsp; The windows are consistent in detail and composition with the original design for the adjacent hotel windows and the stables-coach house entryway. The small window to the south is also not believed to have been part of the original building, but is also likely over 100 years old and features a segmental-arched opening and a stone sill. The stables-coach house building has sufficient integrity to convey its original purpose as part of the hotel complex and displays a level of craftsmanship consistent for a stable-coach house, which maintains the stylistic elements of the main hotel building.
As part of the Little York Hotel complex, the stables and coach house building have historic and associative value as they yield information about the Old Town of York Neighbourhood and the culture of travel and transportation in late 19th-century City of Toronto.
The entire Little York Hotel complex, including the stables and coach house were constructed to the designs of the prominent and prolific architectural firm of Langley, Langley &amp; Burke.&nbsp; Their work as a partnership and as individuals extended for more than 60 years in the City of Toronto and was well-represented in institutional, ecclesiastical and commercial buildings. The Little York Hotel complex represents their use of the Second Empire style, which Langley had applied to important public buildings such as Government House, 1868 and the General Post Office, 1871-4, to a smaller commercial hotel.&nbsp; As both the Government House and the General Post Office buildings have been demolished the hotel-stables and coach house complex are rare survivors of the Second Empire style phase of their work.
Located in the historic St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District on the edge of the original 1793 Town of York, the Little York Hotel complex represents commercial development along King Street in the 1880s.&nbsp; The stables and coach-house have contextual value as part of the Little York Hotel.&nbsp; The hotel and stables-coach house are important in maintaining and defining the character of the area through their massing, scale, materials and details and through their indication of a pattern of life and travel no longer prevalent, from 140 years ago.&nbsp; In its building form and details it is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Little York Hotel Stables and Coach-house building located at 65 George Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The location of the building as it fronts on to the east side of George Street adjacent to and contiguous with the former Little York Hotel building
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elevation of the original one-storey building
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials include brick cladding with stone sills on the west elevation of the building with the brick string courses, dentil courses and cast-stone keystones in the elliptical and round-arched openings of the carriage way and windows
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The openings including the elliptical-arched carriage way opening and the three adjacent, semi-circular arched window openings.

Lady Edith J. Baillie House&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 501 Vesta Drive is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design-physical, historical-associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of Vesta Drive just north of the junction with Old Forest Hill Road, the property at 501 Vesta Drive is part of a collection of residential properties in the Forest Hill neighbourhood, several of them designed by the same architect, Douglas E. Kertland.&nbsp; By provide a cohesive architectural character through their shared qualities of scale, form and massing, materials and details typical of the 1920s and 1930s, these properties create a sense of place.&nbsp; Built by Wilfred E. Whitten, who commissioned Kertland, the grand Arts and Crafts movement house with Tudor Revival style elements of two-and-a-half storeys features a variety of hipped and gabled roofs with prominent chimneys, bay windows and stone with stucco and half-timbering cladding.&nbsp; Originally owned by the philanthropist Lady Edith J. Baillie, widow of Sir Frank Baillie, the house was subsequently owned for over 60 years by the construction magnate and philanthropist Morry Wingold and his wife Sarah Wingold.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Lady Edith J. Baillie house has design value as an excellent representative of a grand Tudor Revival style house whose design reflects Arts and Crafts movement principles.&nbsp; The Arts and Crafts elements are present in the picturesque composition of the asymmetrical building massing and elevations, the combination of steeply pitched hipped and gabled roofs punctuated by dormers and tall chimneys, the recessed entry porch and projecting bay windows, the variety of window types, arched and flat-headed openings and the cladding which combines rough-cut stone of varying shades with smooth stone around the windows and door openings, and half-timbering on stucco in various patterns.&nbsp; The Tudor Revival style is expressed in the broad Tudor arch of the principal entry opening and panelled door, the wood shields on the west elevation and the half-timbering with carved corner columns on the south-facing, gable-roofed bay.&nbsp;
The Baillie house displays a high degree of artistic merit in the variety evident in the overall building massing, the combination of multiple gable and hipped roofs punctuated with dormers and tall chimneys and in the wealth of detail seen in the materials, including rough and smooth stone, stucco and half timbering, and the range of door and window opening combinations. A high degree of craftsmanship is present in the skilled carpentry required to construct the complex roofscape and in the masonry with its random patterns of various shades and shapes of stone with rough-hewn and smooth surfaces.&nbsp;
The siting of the house on its property with its principal south elevation facing the garden and the narrower, west side elevation facing Vesta Drive is characteristic of the informal quality of Arts and Crafts architecture which responds to the site's topography and orientation.&nbsp; This unusual arrangement is enhanced by the diagonal stone entry path which creates a north-east route to the principal entrance located at the south-west corner of the house with its stone steps and landscaped terraces.&nbsp;
The property has historic value as it has direct association with its first owner Lady Edith J. Baillie (1877-1965) who was recognized for her lifelong contribution to all forms of ""public spirited work"" during peace and war-times.&nbsp; Lady Baillie was the widow of Sir Frank Baillie who was knighted in 1918 for his war-time service to the British government and was a successful financier and innovative industrialist.&nbsp; The property is also valued for its association with Morry and Sarah Wingold who occupied the property for 60 years.&nbsp; Morry was the president of Wingold Construction and a well-known philanthropist, recognized for ""his outstanding leadership and community service.""&nbsp;&nbsp; After his death in 1983, Sarah continued living in the house until 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Constructed in 1930 shortly after the incorporation of Forest Hill Village, the Baillie house contributes to an understanding of the early history of Forest Hill as a residential enclave whose early design by-laws and practises resulted in the carefully crafted, landscaped neighbourhood that exists today.
The Baillie house is representative of the highly-regarded architect Douglas E. Kertland, who won the competition to design the CNE's Automotive Building (1928-9).&nbsp; Kertland's residential architecture was widely published from the mid-1920s to the 1940s and he designed several houses which are adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Baillie House.&nbsp;
Situated on the east side of Vesta Drive just north of the junction with Old Forest Hill Road, the Baillie house maintains and supports the character of the neighbourhood, contributing to its sense of place. It is one in a series of Arts and Crafts houses with Tudor Revival style details sharing a two-and-a-half storey-scale with complex asymmetrical massing, a unified mix of materials featuring stone, stucco, half-timbering and brick and a consistent landscaped and well-treed setback.&nbsp; Constructed in 1930, as one of a number of Kertland-designed houses in the neighborhood, and as a part of the development of the Forest Hill Village, the house is functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings
The heritage attributes of the Baillie House property at 501 Vesta Drive are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the house-form building on the east side of Vesta Drive with its principal elevation facing the garden to the south
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half-storey house with its asymmetrically composed building massing and roofscape combining hipped and gabled roofs, with flaring bell-cast curved edges, punctuated by dormer windows and two tall chimneys, bay windows and a recessed, south-facing principal entrance
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone cladding material which includes rough-hewn, multi-toned stone with dark mortar at the first floor and part of the second floor, smooth ashlar-finished stone around the primary entryway, adjacent windows and the bay-windows on the west elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stucco and half-timbering featured primarily on the second floor level but also in the stair-case bay on the west elevation, the gable roofed bay on the south elevation (please note: the original architect's drawings indicate that this bay was to have brick laid in a diagonal pattern which may still exist under the current stucco surface)
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood elements including the shields which appear in the centre of two stucco panels on the west elevation, the turned columns on corbel brackets flanking the gabled bay on the south elevation with the drop pendant in the gable roof of this same bay
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The copper material used in the gutters and down spouts which have a rectangular section
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows which are typically arranged in banks of vertical openings between wood or stone frames and have leaded or wood glazing bars, with flat or arched openings including the two pairs adjacent to the main entrance which feature flat headed Tudor arches, the single opening next to the main entrance with its semi-circular arched opening and the dormer windows which have segmentally-curved roofs.&nbsp; On the south elevation, the single-storey bay window with its hipped roof extending to provide a recess for the adjacent door
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main entrance in the south elevation with a Tudor-arched opening with its deep smooth stone recess framing the wood door with its vertical panels beneath a single window
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagonal stone path leading to the principal entrance flanked by a terraced landscape

Reasons for Designation
The property at 292 Main Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
The property at 292 Main Street is located in the East End-Danforth neighbourhood (formerly East Toronto), on the west side of the street between Danforth Avenue and Stephenson Avenue. The property at 292 Main Street contains a single two-storey, detached house-form building completed by 1887.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The house-form building at 292 Main Street represents a rare example of an Ontario Cottage style dwelling in the area. This style is evident from the form and organization of openings on the building&rsquo;s south elevation, which was once the principal elevation. At a later date, the orientation of the principal elevation shifted to the east. The building's design incorporates many High Victorian era embellishments, including the well preserved, fine craftsmanship of its polychromatic brickwork and brick detailing, which is impressive in its employment on all four elevations and suggests the building's visual prominence upon its completion, both on its lot and near the intersection of Main and Danforth.
The subject property is valued for its association with one of East Toronto's most significant residents, Donald George Stephenson, who was a local lumber merchant, landowner and politician, having acted as the Village of East Toronto's first Reeve (1888-1894). Stephenson was also a local speculator/builder who is attributed to having built many brick dwellings in the area in the last quarter of the 19th century, including the subject property at 292 Main Street, where he likely resided until moving to his final residence at the northwest corner of Gerrard Street East and Enderby Road. &nbsp;
Contextually, the house-form building at 292 Main Street defines, supports and maintains the historic character of this portion of East Toronto, where a burgeoning population of railway workers settled following the opening of Grand Trunk Railway's freight yard and station in the mid-1880s. The property is valued as a unique and fine example among a collection of polychromatic brick dwellings located in the Main Street and Stephenson Avenue area attributed to D. G. Stephenson.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 292 Main Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2-storey detached house-form building
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback of the building on the west side of Main Street between Danforth Avenue and Stephenson Avenue
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red and buff brick cladding and detailing on all four elevations
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main gabled roof and the smaller, flat roof surmounting the single-storey bay window on the east elevation, as well as the chimney
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The south elevation, which was originally the principal elevation with its centred entrance, flanked by a window opening to either side (currently bricked in), and surmounted by a centred roof gable containing a pointed-arch/lancet-shaped attic opening with wooden louvres
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east elevation, which is organized into two bays with the entrance at the north end and single-storey bay window at the south end, and two symmetrically-placed openings in the upper storey
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement of the segmental-arched door and window openings on all four elevations
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative buff-coloured brickwork on all four elevations, with the two double string-courses running along the top and bottom of the upper storey, the drop pendant motif above all door and window openings, the stepped buff brick base, and the three soldier courses set in a sawtooth pattern below each of the openings in the bay window on the east elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative metalwork balustrade crowning the flat roof of the single-storey bay window on the east elevation&nbsp;

Description
Located in the Don Mills neighbourhood on the north side of Eglinton Avenue East, west of the intersection with Don Mills Road and contained by the CPR railway line and the Don River ravine, the property contains the former Canadian IBM headquarters building.&nbsp; The building complex is composed of a central, three-storey block with five wings of one to four storeys completed in 1967 and extended in 1970-71.&nbsp; The building is clad in brick, with a glazing system of solar-bronze tinted glass with black anodized window frames and spandrel panels.&nbsp; Set on a hill top surrounded by mature trees and lawns, its wings form a series of courtyards with lawns. The north entry court features a circular drive with a circle of formally landscaped planting.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The former IBM headquarters building has design value as a representative of a corporate headquarters building in the Late Modern style.&nbsp; The building displays a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit in its innovative and dramatically simple composition of blocks which are clad in alternating plain brick and window walls divided into tall vertical openings, framed by narrow brick piers and which step incrementally in relation to the surrounding lawns, mature planting and hill-top setting which responds to the adjacent Don Valley ravine landscape.&nbsp; The high quality design was recognized in 1970 with a nomination for a Massey Medal for Architecture.&nbsp;
The headquarters building has historic value as it is associated with IBM, the technologically innovative and internationally influential American company and its development and expansion in Canada over the past century.&nbsp; It was with the opening of its Canadian subsidiary in Toronto in 1917 that the company first acquired its identity as International Business Machines Co. Ltd. (IBM).&nbsp; The building is also valued for its association with the history and development of Don Mills from a 19th century settlement to a significant mid-20th century, fully-planned subdivision, privately developed by E. P. Taylor.&nbsp; It is also valued for its association with the architectural firm John B. Parkin Associates, one of Canada's leading Modernist and most prolific firms of the 1950s and 1960s who contributed many significant buildings to Don Mills during this period.
Situated on a well-treed hill-top overlooking Eglinton Avenue, contained by the historic factors of the Don Mills Road, Eglinton Avenue, the CPR railway line and Don Valley ravine, the property has contextual value as a landmark within the community for over 60 years.&nbsp; It is also valued for maintaining the character of the area which features many mid-century modern industrial buildings of distinctive high-quality design surrounding Don Mills.&nbsp; The design of the building and landscape responds to, and provides continuity with, the adjacent Don Valley River ravine.&nbsp; As a successor to IBM's first industrial building in Don Mills, it is visually, physically and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the former IBM headquarters building completed in 1967 and extended in 1970 on the property at 1150 Eglinton Avenue East are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, set back and orientation of the building, as it is located on the north side of Eglinton Avenue.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting of the building on a hill top, surrounded by trees and shrubs, with a series of open courtyards with grass lawns extending around the complex
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrival sequence to the north entrance with the driveway approaching on axis with the north entrance then circling around the north court with a central circular landscaped planted area

Reasons for Designation
The Capitol Theatre Building
The properties at 2490 Yonge Street (with entrance addresses at 2492-2504 Yonge Street) and 2506 Yonge Street (with entrance addresses at 2508 and 2510 Yonge Street) are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Castlefield Avenue, the properties at 2490-2506 Yonge Street (with additional entrance addresses) contain a three-storey complex that was initially completed in 1914 as the York Theatre and, following the addition in 1922 of a three-storey building with a new entrance to the theatre adjoined by commercial storefronts along Yonge Street, renamed the Capitol Theatre Building.&nbsp; In the late 1990s, the theatre was converted to an event venue known as the Capitol Event Theatre.
City Council included the properties at 2490 Yonge Street and 2506 Yonge Street (on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register on November 9, 2016.
Statement of Significance
Covering half of the block on the west of Yonge Street, north of Castlefield Avenue, the Capitol Theatre Building has design value as a three-storey complex distinguished by its large scale and elegant proportions with architectural features from the early-20th century Classical Revival style.&nbsp; Of particular note is the classical detailing on the Yonge Street elevation where the spandrels on the monumental two-storey round-arched window openings and the panels above the paired pilasters feature garland motifs.
The associative value of the Capitol Theatre Building is linked to the role of the complex in the development of the main street character of Yonge Street in the 1920s after the annexation of the Town of North Toronto by the City of Toronto. The Capitol Theatre Building is one of the earliest complexes on the west side of Yonge Street, contributing to the formation of a streetwall. The properties contribute to the social history of the area as a local theatre serving the community since the World War I era and as an event venue beginning in the late 20th century.
The Capitol Theatre Building is also valued for its connection to the notable Toronto architect Murray Brown, who was associated with the evolution of the building in the 1920s as it was converted from a combined silent movie and vaudeville theatre to a venue devoted to motion pictures with sound.&nbsp; In solo practice after World War I, Murray Brown (1885-1958) was best known for projects that included Postal Station K (1936) on Yonge Street, south of the subject properties.&nbsp; However, he designed several buildings for the Famous Players chain in Ontario, Saskatoon and Halifax, including two theatres in the Yonge-Eglinton area, with the Belsize Theatre (dating to 1927, renamed the Crest Theatre and now known as the Regent Theatre) on Mount Pleasant Road recognized on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Contextually, the Capitol Theatre Building is valued for its contribution to the commercial main street character of Yonge Street north of Eglinton Avenue, particularly north of Roselawn Avenue, which began in the early-20th century and is typified by blocks of surviving two and three-storey commercial buildings.&nbsp; The contextual value of the subject building is also related to its historical, visual and physical links to its surroundings on Yonge Street, where it is adjoined to the south, north and east by a collection of heritage properties recognized on the City's Heritage Register.&nbsp; The Capitol Theatre Building is a local landmark in North Toronto, anchoring the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Castlefield Avenue with its chamfered corner, distinctive scale and decorative detailing.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Capitol Theatre Building located on the properties at 2490- 2506 Yonge Street (including entrance addresses) are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Castlefield Avenue
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and metal detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the stone band course and the metal (originally stone) cornice on the east elevation on Yonge Street, the southeast corner, and the two easternmost bays of the south side elevation on Castlefield Avenue
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chamfered southeast corner adjoining Yonge Street and Castlefield Avenue with the stone quoins
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation on Yonge Street, which is organized into 15 bays, including two double-width bays (second from the south end and seventh from the north end)
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (east) elevation on Yonge Street, the first-floor storefronts, including the unit with the convenience address at 2504 Yonge Street that retains its vintage stainless-steel detailing, and the round-arched entrances at 2498 and 2510 Yonge Street (the storefronts and entrances have been altered over time)
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theatre entrance and adjoining store (with convenience addresses at 2492 and 2494 Yonge Street), which are placed near the south end of the east elevation and feature a marquee, box office and entrances with glass and stainless-steel detailing dating to the mid-20th century
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the east elevation, the southeast corner and the two easternmost bays on the south side elevation, with the symmetrically placed flat-headed openings with the stone sills in the second and third stories

Reasons for the Partial Repeal
City of Toronto By-law 969-2005 was enacted on November 24, 2005.&nbsp; The By-law designates the property at 158 Sterling Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Act.&nbsp; The property contains the heritage building known as the Northern Aluminum Company Building (the ""Heritage Building""). The legal description currently includes the neighbouring properties municipally known as 20 Perth Avenue and 150,150R and 164 Sterling Road.
The property at 158 Sterling Road was legally severed into three parcels: the first parcel identified as 158 Sterling Road; the second parcel identified as 150, 150R and 164 Sterling Road; and the third parcel as 20 Perth Avenue by notice of decision issued October 13, 2015 and June 15, 2016. Following the severances, the heritage designation remained on title for all three properties.

Amendment of Designating By-law
Nealon House
City of Toronto By-law 91-91 designating the property at 197 King Street East under Part IV, Section 29 of the Act is revised to update the cultural heritage values and attributes in accordance with the 2005 amendments to the Act.&nbsp; The property containing the building known historically as the Nealon House meets Ontario Regulation 9/06 of the Act, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the south side of the street between Frederick Street (east) and George Street (west), the property at 197 King Street East contains a four-storey commercial building that was constructed in 1888 as a hotel named the Nealon House after its owner, grocer James Nealon.&nbsp; Following Nealon&rsquo;s untimely death, the property was acquired in 1890 by Daniel and John Kennedy, who continued to operate the hotel.&nbsp; The property remained in continuous use as a hotel and a tavern for nearly a century.&nbsp;
The property at 197 King Street East was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1984 and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1991 by By-law 91-91.&nbsp; The property is identified as a contributing heritage property in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District, which is under appeal in 2019.
Statement of Significance
The property at 197 King Street East has cultural heritage value for its design as a well-crafted late-19th century commercial building with decorative detailing inspired by the most popular architectural styles of the late Victorian era.&nbsp; The Nealon House draws upon the Romanesque Revival, Renaissance Revival and Italianate styles in a design that is distinguished by the decorative stone and brickwork, oversized bay window, elaborate cornice and distinctive corner tower.
The Nealon House is valued for its association with the development, evolution and significance of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood as it evolved from its origins as &ldquo;Old Town,&rdquo; survived the Great Fire of 1849 as the commercial and institutional heart of Toronto, and withstood the economic downturn of the area in the 20th century before it was revitalized in the 1960s.&nbsp; Located within the original boundaries of the Town of York on the community&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; where it replaced an earlier hotel and store, the Nealon House remained in continuous service as a hotel and a tavern for nearly a century.
Contextually, the property at 197 King Street East supports and maintains the historical character of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood as it evolved in the 19th and 20th century from its origins as the Town of York to a mixed-use community highlighted by institutional landmarks that include St. James&rsquo; Cathedral, St. Lawrence Hall and the St. Lawrence Market.&nbsp; The Nealon House is historically and visually linked to its setting within the original 10-block townsite established in 1793 and on Toronto&rsquo;s original &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; where it is part of the important collection of surviving 19th century commercial buildings on King Street East that are recognized on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.&nbsp; With its scale, vintage and decorative features, the Nealon House complements the Christie, Brown and Company Biscuit Factory (1874 with subsequent additions) at 200 King Street East, opposite, which was restored and adaptively reused as George Brown College&rsquo;s St. James Campus and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Nealon House at 197 King Street East are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the south side of King Street East between Frederick (east) and George (west) streets

Description
Located on the north side of Queen Street East between Mutual and Jarvis Streets in the Garden District neighbourhood, and directly across the street from the Designated properties at 99, 107, 109, 111, 115, 123 Queen St E and Warehouse (1903-6), the property at 98 Queen Street East comprises a 4-storey red brick commercial building attached at a ninety degree angle to the warehouse building at 3 Mutual Street (1901). Completed in 1889, the property at 98 Queen Street East was originally owned by local merchant Richard Bigley (1857-1933) who initially operated his stove fitting business from 92-94 Queen Street East. The connected properties at 98 Queen Street East and 3 Mutual Street were included on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register in 1973. In 2013, the City officially named the lane at the rear of these properties, Richard Bigley Laneway.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The property at 98 Queen Street East (completed in 1889) is valued as a fine representative example of a Late Victorian commercial main street building with its unusual organization of round-arched and bow windows on the upper storeys and a high level of craftsmanship in the brick and wood detailing on the principal (south) elevation, including the decorative brick checkerboard patterning and corbelling, as well as the ornate wood mullions and denticulated cornices.
The property is associated with Richard Bigley, for whom the existing building was constructed along with 3 Mutual Street.&nbsp; It remained his business location for nearly 40 years following over 10 years next door at 92-94 Queen Street East. Bigley was a local stove fitting and furnace merchant whose importance on the block is captured in the name plate on the parapet at 98 Queen Street East and, more recently, the Richard Bigley laneway extending between Mutual and Jarvis Streets at the rear of the subject buildings.
The existing property at 98 Queen Street East is also valued for its association with the prominent Toronto architectural firm of Craig, Zeidler &amp; Strong, who maintained offices at this location through the 1970s.
Together with the mixed-use residential/commercial/commercial and industrial typologies of the rest of the subject properties at 90-94 Queen Street East and 100-104 Queen Street East, as well as their architectural styles, the Richard Bigley building at 98 Queen Street East contributes to an understanding of the historic character of Queen Street East in the last quarter of the 19th century, when these main street buildings and the merchants who originally owned them established themselves on Queen Street East in the Garden District neighbourhood.
The adjoining, 4-storey brick commercial and warehouse buildings at 98 Queen Street East and 3 Mutual Street have contextual value as their scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to their location along Queen Street East and represent the mid-to-late 19th-century mixed-use character of Queen Street East.&nbsp;
Within the context of a neighbourhood developed as a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial main street properties located at the southern edge of the Garden District area, the adjoining 4-storey brick buildings at 98 Queen Street East and 3 Mutual Street are valued as a collection with historic, physical and visual links to their surroundings for over 120 years.

Together with 90-98 Queen Street East and 103 Mutual Street, the commercial buildings at 100-104 Queen Street East, along with the rest of the terrace at 106-114, contribute to an understanding of the historic character of Queen Street East in the last quarter of the 19th century, when businesses and the merchants who owned them established themselves along Queen Street East in the Garden District location.

33 Sherbourne Street
Reasons for Designation
The property at 33 Sherbourne Street (including the entrance addresses at 33 A Sherbourne Street and 176 Front Street East) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design and contextual value.
Description
Located on the east side of the street between Front Street East and King Street East, the property at 33 Sherbourne Street contains a two-storey early 20th century vernacular commercial building that was completed in 1918.&nbsp; The property is located on one of the original 10 blocks of the Town of York, and is one of the few remaining buildings that reflects the period of industrialization within the original 10 blocks. The Whitfield Building was constructed as an extension to a factory building located to the south at 176 Front Street East, and served as office space for the John Whitfield Company, which managed the Dominion Chain Works located on the property.&nbsp; The building remained as the offices for the John Whitfield Company until the death of John Whitfield in 1926, after which the company &ndash; later renamed Whitfield Engineering &ndash; retained space in the building, while leasing additional space out to a variety of small manufacturers. The Dominion Chain Works factory was demolished in 1955, and replaced by a service station.&nbsp; The property at 33 Sherbourne Street was identified as a contributing property in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District Plan, which was adopted by City Council in 2015.
Statement of Significance
The property at 33 Sherbourne Street has cultural heritage value as a representative example of an early 20th century vernacular commercial building, constructed to provide office space for related manufacturing uses. The Whitfield Building is a unique example of a building designed to provide office space for related manufacturing uses, and retains physical features that are both reflective of its utilitarian purposes, while being reminiscent of early 19th century storefront buildings, including the brick piers which vertically articulate its principal fa&ccedil;ade, its 2-storey streetwall, and the window openings, which are designed at a pedestrian height and scale. The property at 33 Sherbourne Street is located on a block that transitioned from the industrial and manufacturing character of Front Street East to the main street character of King Street East, with the design of the building reflecting these two unique contexts.
The property at 33 Sherbourne Street supports the historical context of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, and in particular the original 10 blocks of the Town of York, as it evolved from its planned town context in the early 1800s to a manufacturing and industrial district in the latter half of the 19th century.&nbsp; The Whitfield Building contributes to the surviving collection of recognized heritage buildings from all phases of the development of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood, and is one of the few remaining buildings within the original 10 blocks of the Town of York that reflects the neighbourhood's manufacturing and industrial period of development.&nbsp; With its location on the east side of Sherbourne Street between Front Street East and King Street East, the Whitfield Building is part of an important block that transitions from the industrial character of Front Street East, to the main street character of King Street East, and which includes buildings that help support an understanding of that historic context, including 178 Front Street East (1941), and the National Hotel and Tavern at 251 King Street East (1868, with additions).
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Whitfield Building at 33 Sherbourne Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement and setback of the building on the east side of Sherbourne Street between Front Street East and King Street East

The Pearlman &amp; Goldberg Building was constructed as a warehouse facility for the Pearlman &amp; Goldberg Company, which traded in hides, wools and furs, and replaced an earlier warehouse building that served a similar purpose.&nbsp; The building served as the warehouse for the Pearlman &amp; Goldberg Company through the 1950s, after which it was sold to Samuel Harris, who ran his fabric and textiles business out of the building until the company was sold in 1993.&nbsp; The property at 178 Front Street East was identified as a contributing heritage property in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District Plan, which was adopted by City Council in 2015.
Statement of Significance
The property at 178 Front Street East has contextual value as it supports the historical context of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, and in particular the original 10 blocks of the Town of York, which evolved from its planned town context in the early 1800s to a manufacturing and industrial district in the latter half of the 19th century.&nbsp; The Pearlman &amp; Goldberg Building contributes to the collection of recognized heritage buildings from all phases of the development of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood, and is one of the few remaining buildings within the original 10 blocks of the Town of York that reflects the neighbourhood's manufacturing and industrial period of development.&nbsp; The building's brick cladding, planar fa&ccedil;ade with minimal ornamentation, and large windows that are designed to provide access to light &ndash; rather than engage with the sidewalk and pedestrian realm &ndash; are features that relate to the neighbourhood's manufacturing context.&nbsp; With its location on the north side of Front Street East between Sherbourne Street and Princess Street, the Pearlman &amp; Goldberg Building is part of an important block that transitions from the industrial character of Front Street East, to the main street character of King Street East, and which includes buildings that help support an understanding of that historic context, including 33 Sherbourne Street (1918), and the National Hotel and Tavern at 251 King Street East (1868, with additions).
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Pearlman &amp; Goldberg Building at 178 Front Street East are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement and setback of the building on the north side of Front Street East between Sherbourne Street and Frederick Street
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two and a half storey rectangular-shaped plan building
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick cladding of the principal (south) fa&ccedil;ade of the building
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the simple brick parapet and metal coping
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) fa&ccedil;ade which is divided into five bays, the central three bays containing flat headed rectangular window openings on the first and second storeys, and the outer two bays containing entrances with windows above, and which are both slightly recessed from the otherwise planar principal facade
Note: The side (west) and rear (north) facades are not identified as heritage attributes.

Description
The property at 117 St George Street (including the entrance address at 119 St George Street) is located on the east side of St George Street between Bloor Street West and Hoskin Avenue. The property known as Woodsworth College contains a collection of one-, two- and three-storey institutional buildings owned by the University of Toronto, including the Alexander McArthur House (1891-2), the former Drill Hall (1939), the officers' quarters (1947), the Margaret Fletcher House,[1] and 1990-2 KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. infill and adaptive reuse project. The Woodsworth College property was identified as a ""character-defining resource"" in the Heritage Impact Assessment for the University of Toronto Secondary Plan.
The earliest building is the Alexander McArthur House, a three-storey Richardsonian Romanesque style, stone-clad building, with a one-storey bay addition to the south. The house was constructed in 1891-2 for Alexander McArthur, a wealthy Toronto lumber merchant, who continued to live in the house until his death in 1895, as did his wife until c.1900. The house was designed by the well-known Toronto architect David Brash Dick (1846-1925) and the southern one-storey addition by Francis S. Baker (1867-1926) in 1911.
The Alexander McArthur House was listed on the City's original Heritage Inventory on 20 June 1973.
At the southwest corner of the property is the former Drill Hall, later known as the Examination Hall and now known as Kruger Hall Commons. It was constructed as a Drill Hall in 1939 after the property at 117 St George Street was purchased by the Board of Governors for the University of Toronto Contingent of the Canadian Officers Training Corps (COTC). They occupied the property until 1968, after which point the organization was dissolved. The Drill Hall was designed by the architectural firm of Craig and Madill.
The western addition to the former Drill Hall, known as the officers' quarters, was designed by the firm Allward &amp; Gouinlock in 1947. It is a two-storey structure that served as the officers' quarters for the COTC.
To the north of the former Drill Hall is a house-form building known as the Margaret Fletcher House. It was constructed sometime from 1924-47 and the architect is not currently known. It was incorporated into the KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. addition in 1990-2 its rear (east) elevation is the only remaining visible elevation.
The property at 117 St George Street continued to house a variety of institutions up until the early-1970s, including the Department of Military and Navel Studies, the University of Toronto Business School, and the School of Graduate Studies. In 1974, Woodsworth College was established as a new college for part-time students, and the college occupied the McArthur House.
In 1990 the firm Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB), with Barton Myers Associates Inc. as the consulting architect, were commissioned to create an expansion plan for the college. This infill and adaptive reuse project involved alterations and adaptive reuse of existing buildings, as well as the addition of a tower and entrance at the southwest corner fronting St George Street and an L-shaped addition at the rear. The KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. project unified the previously separated buildings to create a complex and sense of place that now comprises Woodsworth College. The L-shaped building enclosed the edges of the new Peter F. Bronfman Courtyard and abutted the rear of the three-house form buildings at 117, 121, and 123 St George Street. The project was completed in 1992. KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. were awarded the Governor General Awards of Excellence for their design that same year and an Ontario Association of Architects Architectural Excellence Award in 1993.
Woodsworth College continues to occupy the property at 117 St George Street today.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The Alexander McArthur House:
The Alexander McArthur House has design value as a well-designed house-form building and is representative of the Richardsonian Romanesque style with the addition of select Queen Anne Revival style elements. Both styles appeared frequently in buildings of this typology along St George Street north of Hoskin Avenue. The Romanesque Revival style had two phases, the earlier pre-1850s phase and the second ""Richardsonian Romanesque"" phase, which is associated with the work of the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-86). In the property at 117 St George Street, elements of the Richardsonian Romanesque character are expressed in the rusticated brown Credit Valley stone masonry throughout, the heavy massing, the flat-headed windows with stone sills and lintels, and the use of ornate motifs in the second-storey balcony. The style is further evident in the highly decorative ornamentation, including stiff-leaf foliage and volutes throughout. This can be seen in the columns and capitals in the principal (west) entry porch, which also feature fluting, as well as in the capitals of the window to the left (north) of the entrance and in the upper-storey windows to the right (south). The latter also include stiff leaf foliage carved into stone panels. The style can also be seen in the round-headed window of the second-storey balcony, which is set into a recessed stone arch. The Queen Anne Revival style is particularly evident in the pediments at the principal (west) and side (north and south) elevations, which are ornamented with fish scale shingles, dentil molding, and corbel tables in the side (north and south) pediments, as well as in the open pediment in the west end of the principal (west) elevation with dentil molding along the angular slopes of the cornice. The double-hung windows in the pediments that are grouped in three at the principal (west) and side (north) elevation and four at the side (south) elevation are also reminiscent of the Queen Anne Revival style. The style is also articulated in the flat-headed double-hung windows, which appear singly, in pairs, and in groups of three and four, and in the presence of multiple roofs.
The Former Drill Hall:
The former Drill Hall has design and physical value as a representative example of the large drill hall building type that gained popularity in Canada during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Large drill halls or drill sheds, as they were also known, were traditionally utilitarian structures and they were built to provide two basic militia requirements &ndash; a place in which to drill and secure dry armouries.[2] The construction of these buildings began during the latter half of the nineteenth century, when the Canadian Federal Government endeavoured to construct spaces to train and maintain volunteers and professional militia regiments. Although the former Drill Hall at 117 St George Street was built in 1939, it contains the same double-height open interior volume, longitudinal form, and continuous gambrel roof, and is similar to several others that were built the decade prior. The general scale and form of the drill halls remained consistent, and the simplicity in the exterior of the former Drill Hall at the University of Toronto was in line with the twentieth-century Modernist penchant for unornamented utilitarian buildings. Several similar drill halls constructed during the interwar period, with horizontal forms and large expanses of glazing at the roof peaks, which are two features evident at the University of Toronto's Drill Hall, have been added to Canada's Register of Historic Places. The north and west elevations of the former Drill Hall at 117 St George Street were altered during the 1990-2 KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. project and the original brick masonry has since been reclad. However, the form of the present building has retained its double-height volume, longitudinal form, and continuous gambrel roof, which represents its original design and function as a drill hall.
The 1990-2 KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. Infill and Adaptive Reuse Project:
The 1990-2 tower addition to the officers' quarters building fronting St George Street and the L-shaped extension at the northeast corner of the property have design value as they are representative of the architectural expression of two of Toronto's most influential architectural firms. The former, the tower, with two-storeys, an entrance on the ground floor and a balcony at the second-storey, a solid brick and stone base, and a squared-off spire with heavy massing, is quintessentially Myers and KPMB, who initially worked together out of Myers' office and designed the AGO expansion fronting Dundas Street West (now demolished) together, which contains a similar tower. The rusticated stone masonry of the west wall of the officers' quarters, which abuts the tower, also creates consistency with the neighbouring Alexander McArthur House. The latter, the L-shaped extension, with its largely two-storey scale (it is one-storey west of the Margaret Fletcher House) and arcade connecting the existing buildings and creating an open central courtyard, is reflective of KPMB's ability to unify distinct buildings into a cohesive whole as well as their strength in creating well-designed urban spaces. This is largely achieved with the use of warm red brick and stone skirting throughout, which matches the Alexander McArthur House, and subsequently creates consistency with the existing buildings in the complex.
Historical and Associative Value
The Alexander McArthur House is valued for its association with the lumber merchant Alexander McArthur, who was the President of McArthur Brothers, one of the largest exporters of lumber to foreign markets. Forming the company with his brothers John and Peter in 1872, they acquired cutting rights on extensive limits throughout Canada and the United States, including in the Ottawa Valley, around Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, and in Western Canada. Alexander was President of the company, and although they were based in Toronto, they also operated out of Michigan from 1886. That same year, they incorporated under the name McArthur Brothers Company Limited and shipped lumber and staves to the United Kingdom and had an export company in Quebec.
The Alexander McArthur House, the former Drill Hall, and the 1947 addition of the officers' quarters to the former Drill Hall are valued for their association with the COTC, which was the first organization established by the Canadian government that allowed students to qualify for commissions in the Active Militia. The University of Toronto Contingent received formal authorization on 15 October 1914 after the outbreak of the war, and for much of its history, the COTC had been directed out of a house at 184 College Street. The Board of Governors purchased the Alexander McArthur house for the COTC in early 1939 and the interior was altered to provide a room, quartermaster stores, offices, and classrooms. Construction of the Drill Hall began on 1 June, and when it was completed, it gave University of Toronto students enrolled in the Canadian Officers' Training Corps a proper space to take their drills. The 1947 officers' quarters addition is also valued for its association with the COTC. An Ontario Heritage Trust plaque near the entrance of the principal (west) elevation commemorates the property's association with the COTC.
The Alexander McArthur House is valued for its association with the notable Toronto architect David Brash Dick. Born in Edinburgh where he was educated at the Edinburgh School of Design, Dick served as a draughtsman with the eminent Scottish architects, Peddie and Kinnear, before relocating to Chicago in 1873. During the same year, Dick moved to Toronto where he worked in partnership with Scottish expatriate Robert Grant until 1876, after which point he established a solo practice. Dick's architectural portfolio in Toronto is expansive, and in 1878, the Board of Management at the University of Toronto appointed him as University Architect. He designed numerous buildings for the University of Toronto, including the Biological Building (1888-90; demolished), University Library (1891-2), and Wycliffe College (1890-2), as well as ten houses on St George Street. He designed buildings in numerous styles, including the Richardsonian Romanesque and Queen Anne Revival styles.
The property at 117 St George Street is valued for its association with the careers of the nationally and internationally acclaimed architects KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. as it demonstrates the ideas of both architectural firms, which specialize in urban revitalization through the rehabilitation of existing buildings, appropriate infill, and the creation of well-designed urban spaces. Although both architectural firms have a diverse portfolio outside of Canada, they are often considered among two of Toronto's most influential architectural firms. Barton Myers co-founded and was principal of the firm Diamond and Myers from 1968-75. After the dissolution of the partnership, Myers formed an independent practice under the name Barton Myers Associates Inc. with offices in Toronto (1975-87) and Los Angeles (1984-present). He has received Gold Medals from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the American Institute of Architects. KPMB was established in 1987, and many of their earlier projects were completed in association with Myers' firm, including Woodsworth College and the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) Stage III Expansion (1992; now demolished). The firm continues to demonstrate their prowess in the adaptive reuse of heritage buildings, completing numerous projects of this kind throughout their career. Several of their adaptive reuse projects have been for academic institutions, including the Munk School of Global Affairs (2012) and the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management expansion (2012) for the University of Toronto, and Adams Center for Musical Arts at Yale University (2017) and the Julis Romo Rabinowitz Building &amp; Louis A. Simpson International Building at Princeton University (2017). The firm has consistently been recognized for their architectural contributions and they have been presented with over 100 awards.
Contextual Value
Located on the east side of St George Street south of Bloor Street West, the Alexander McArthur House has contextual value as it defines and maintains the character of the ""North Campus"" area on St George Street between Bloor Street West and Hoskin Avenue, which is largely comprised of two- and three-storey nineteenth-century houses and later post-WWII institutional buildings.&nbsp; The ""North Campus"" area was slower to develop than elsewhere on the campus. While the portion of the campus on St George Street south of Hoskin Avenue already had some twenty-five university-owned buildings by the early-1920s, there were only six in comparison North of Hoskin Avenue, and properties were, for the most part, still private residences. The house-form property at 117 St George Street also supports areas historic character as a residential street where Toronto's elite commissioned well-known architects to design their residences.
The Alexander McArthur House has value as it is physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to its surroundings, especially to the properties to the north at 121 and 123 St George Street, in terms of scale, period, and style. This is supported by the placement and orientation of the building on the east side of St George Street, set back from the street with a landscaped setting separating the property from the public realm with paved entrances, which can similarly be seen in the neighbouring properties to the north.
The KPMB and Barton Myers Associates Inc. tower addition at the southwest corner of the property fronting St George Street has value as it is visually linked to the properties to the south, which maintain a similar setback, and contributes to the post-war institutional character while maintaining the residential character in scale and material. It is also visually linked to the neighbouring Innis College Residence at 111 St George Street, which is clad in red brick and rusticated stone skirting at its base.

National Equipment Company Ltd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Description
Located on the south side of Wabash Avenue, east of Sorauren Avenue, the property at 41 Wabash Avenue is a two-and-a-half storey rectangular-plan, brick-clad volume constructed for the National Equipment Company Ltd. in 1912 in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The building, originally known as the National Equipment Company Ltd. and more recently known as J. S. Addison Plumbing, has physical and design value as a representative of an early twentieth-century, industrial warehouse typology.&nbsp; This is evident in its location on the north edge of the property with no set back, the simple block massing, brick cladding and regular distribution of window openings which is interrupted to accommodate functional requirements such as loading bays and entrances.&nbsp; Although an industrial form, the building has architectural refinement in the raising of the parapet into a broad pediment on its principal (north) elevation facing Wabash Avenue and in the arrangement of the window openings in a classical manner which features hierarchy and symmetry presented in the double width of the central window aligned with the pediment and flanked by two windows, half its width on either side at both upper levels.&nbsp;
The building has historic value as it is associated with the industrial development of area which was encouraged by location of the railways to the east of this section of the Roncesvalles neighbourhood.&nbsp; The purchase and development of the property at 41 Wabash Avenue in 1911 by the National Equipment Company followed several other industries which located between Sorauren Avenue and the railway line in the triangular area just south of Dundas Street West including the Canada Linseed Oil Mills Ltd on the north side of Wabash Avenue. These industries provided employment for the Roncesvalles neighbourhood to the west and south and to Brockton village to the east.
Contextually, with its century-old materials, composition and form, this industrial block has heritage value as it maintains the industrial character of this eastern section of the historic Roncesvalles neighbourhood. Located to the south-east of Dundas Street West and the railway lines, the neighbourhood has had a continuous mix of low-rise industrial and residential buildings for over 110 years.&nbsp; The addition of Sorauren Park and the smaller Charles G. Williams Park has added important amenity to the area which will be enhanced by the adaptive re-use of the Canada Linseed Oil building on the north side of Wabash Avenue as a community centre.&nbsp; The integration of heritage and its adaptive re-use will build on and enhance the richness and variety of the sense of place in this historic and evolving neighbourhood.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 41 Wabash Avenue are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the industrial warehouse building on the south side of Wabash Avenue&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half-storey building including the raised parapet with it gable form on the north elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials including the brick cladding, the stone lintels over the loading bays, the bush-hammered stone sills, the stone blocks set as the top masonry course beneath the top of the windows on the north elevation, and projecting wood window hoods over the second storey windows on the north elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north elevation the arrangement of openings including the wide window openings flanked by two narrower windows at the upper levels, the door at grade and the adjacent opening presumably originally used for loading and now filled in with blocks
-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west elevation, at all three levels, the three pairs of long narrow window openings with segmental-arched headers towards the south end (one of the openings has been extended to floor level) and the loading dock opening at the lower level at the north end (filled in) with a single narrow, segmental-arched headed opening above at the upper level

Description
Located on the east side of Huron Street south of Dupont Street in The Annex neighbourhood, the property at 661 Huron Street was completed in 1891 and comprises a 2.5-storey brick and stone house-form building originally constructed as a single family residence. From 1924 through 1933, the building became known as the Elizabeth Rye Home, a children&rsquo;s home established by the Church of England&rsquo;s Waifs and Strays Society that housed and trained young British girls for domestic service.
Statement of Significance
Design/Physical Value
The property at 661 Huron Street has cultural heritage value as a fine representative example of Queen Anne Revival styling applied to a large house-form building in the last decade of the nineteenth century. The style, identified by the variety of materials and their decorative detailing, asymmetrical profile and complicated roof lines including conical roofs, represented the exuberance of architectural styling of the late Victorian era. Despite a number of later additions and alterations over the years, the original building at 661 Huron Street maintains its physical integrity and is noteworthy for its attractive combination of forms, massing and stonework.
Historical/Associative Value
The property at 661 Huron Street is valued for its associations with the Christian organization known as the Waifs and Strays Society established by the Church of England. From 1924 through 1933 the property, then known as the Elizabeth Rye Home, housed and trained immigrant British girls for employment in domestic service.&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property at 661 Huron Street has cultural heritage value for its visual and historical links to its setting in The Annex neighbourhood.&nbsp; Its appearance reflects the late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century development of the area as one of the most sought-after residential enclaves in Toronto where the city's leading citizens occupied large-scale houses.&nbsp; The property at 661 Huron Street is significant in context with the adjacent property at 663-665 Huron Street directly to the north, as these two properties together comprise the earliest structures built on the block between Dupont Street and Bernard Avenue following Simeon Janes&rsquo; subdivision of this portion of The Annex neighbourhood in 1886.
The heritage attributes of the property at 661 Huron Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the east side of Huron Street south of Dupont Street
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2.5-storey plan above a raised basement
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick and rusticated stone cladding and the stone and wood detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The complicated rooflines with their combination of hipped, gabled and conical roofs and rectangular brick chimney rising just behind the principal (west) elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The various decorative cornices at the rooflines on the principal (west) elevation and corner tower with the wood soffits and dentil detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the terracotta fish-scale shingling on the conical roofs and central gable peak
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation, which is asymmetrically arranged including a 2-storey corner tower at the north end and an upper-storey oriel window at the south end

Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Dundas Street East and Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood and directly across the street from St. Michael's Cathedral, the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is part of a group of three-storey Georgian style row houses that remain from the original ten-unit terrace completed in 1848. The current building at 195 Church Street was reconstructed in 1981 following the removal of the original structure due to fire in 1956. All four properties were included in the City of Toronto's inaugural list of properties added to the Inventory of Heritage Properties in 1973, including the then-vacant lot at 195 Church Street.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued as a rare example of urban row housing in Toronto completed before 1850. The Georgian styling, popular before the second half of the 19th century, signals some of the city&rsquo;s earliest buildings. While this type and style of building was once prevalent in downtown Toronto, the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued as a rare surviving example that is also considered to be the city's best preserved set of Georgian row houses.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued for its association with architect John Tully, who is attributed to the design. Tully is recognized as one of the first professional architects to work in Toronto, where only a small number of his commissions survive, including the nearby designated properties at 68-70 Shuter Street (Edward Cooper Houses). Like the Shuter Street properties, 195 and 197 Church Street were originally owned by local merchant and speculative developer, Edward Cooper.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it defines the remaining portion of the original ten-unit brick terrace and, more broadly, the mid-19th century residential character of Church Street and the surrounding area. Within the context of a neighbourhood in flux due to ongoing development pressure, the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued together as a group of row houses with historic, physical and visual links to its surroundings for over 170 years.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is highlighted by the current infill replacement building at 195 Church Street, constructed in 1981 as a compatible replacement that re-establishes the unity of the historic row.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the east side of the street between Shuter Street and Dundas Street East
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the red brick terrace with its three storey height with pitched roofs, chimneys and corbelled brick firebreak end walls defining the individual properties
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials with the red and buff brick, and the brick, stone and wood detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevations, which are symmetrically organized with entrances located in the left (north) bays and flat-headed window openings with stone lintels and sills in all three storeys
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration with the double-hung sash windows, including the six-over-six panes, where existing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The entries, which are recessed and have flat-headed door openings with transoms beneath stone lintels
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative, polychrome brickwork with the buff brick stringcourses at all the levels, the vertical quoining delineating individual properties in the row and coffered panel brick frieze below the rooflines
195 Church Street
Reasons for Designation
The property at 195 Church Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Dundas Street East and Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood and directly across the street from St. Michael's Cathedral, the property at 195 Church Street is part of a group of four three-storey Georgian style row houses that remain from the original ten-unit terrace completed in 1848. The current building at 195 Church Street was reconstructed in 1981 by Mekinda, Snyder &amp; Weis Architects in a compatible manner to the rest of the surviving row, following the removal of the original structure in 1956. All four properties were included in the City of Toronto's inaugural list of properties added to the Inventory of Heritage Properties in 1973, including the then-vacant lot at 195 Church Street.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 195 Church Street is valued as a significant example of compatible urban infill within the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace which is valued as a rare example of urban row housing originally completed before 1850. The current replacement building at 195 Church Street (1981) represents the influence of prevailing heritage conservation theory in the latter half of the 20th century, when architects, preservationists and planners were exploring new ways of repairing lost or damaged urban fabric in order to re-establish the cultural significance of a site.
The principal (west) elevation refers to the historic row's Georgian styling, which was popular before the second half of the 19th century and signals some of Toronto's earliest buildings. This reinterpretation also respects the form, articulation and materiality of the rest of the row, and supports the prevailing streetscape character while incorporating identifiably contemporary interpretations of historic features, such as the corbelling above the first and third storey openings, the recessed entrance and third floor balcony, an at-grade second entrance and the omission of a cornice. These small design gestures make evident the contemporary date of construction in contrast to the rest of the Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace, but do so without disrupting the pedestrian scale, rhythm of openings, prevailing materiality and articulation of the streetscape.
Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace is valued as a rare surviving example of a collection of Georgian row houses, considered to be the city's best preserved set and highlighted by the current infill replacement building at 195 Church Street.
The Cooper &amp; Gillespie Terrace has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it defines the remaining portion of the original ten-unit brick terrace and, more broadly, the mid-19th century residential character of Church Street and the surrounding area.

-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the red brick row house with its three storey height and flat roof
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials with the red brick, and the brick and stone detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation, which is symmetrically organized with the recessed entrance located in the left (north) bay and flat-headed window openings

Reasons for Designation
The property at 305 King Street West (including the entrance addresses at 309 and 311 King Street West) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the south side of the street between John Street and Blue Jays Way, the property at 305 King Street West contains a two-storey commercial building that was completed in 1928.&nbsp; The King Building replaced part of a three-storey commercial row built in 1887. The current building is attributed to architect Thomas Elliott Muirhead in his position as staff architect for the John G. Kent Construction Company, which acquired the site in 1923.&nbsp; Five years later, Kent&rsquo;s estate sold the property to the King Investment Company under the direction of Myrtle Warren, and the initial tenants included the Carter Radio Company and the Utah Radio Products Company headed by the new owner.&nbsp; From 1930 until 1956, the property was owned by Harry V. Mallabar (sic), who expanded the subject building and acquired the neighbouring properties for his Malabar Costumes Company (now Malabar Limited).&nbsp; The property at 305 King Street West was identified as a contributing heritage property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District Plan, which was adopted by City Council in 2017 when the King Building was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.
Statement of Significance
The property at 305 King Street West has cultural heritage value as a representative example of an early 20th century commercial building with the symmetry and the cornice with brackets inspired by Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most typologies in the first quarter of the 20th century.&nbsp; Introduced to a streetscape that was originally developed with residential row houses (Hughes Terrace) in the 1850s, followed by commercial storefronts in the 1880s, the King Building was a compatible addition to the block in the 1920s with its setback, cladding and detailing.
The associative value of the King Building is through its contribution to the evolution of the King-Spadina community, which began in the 19th century as an institutional and residential enclave and was transformed after the Great Fire of 1900 into Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre.&nbsp; During the latter period, many of the original buildings were replaced with new edifices, including the subject site where part of a former commercial row became the location of the King Building.
The property at 305 King Street West is also valued for its historical association with John G. (Gowans) Kent, owner of the construction company that developed the site, and his staff architect Thomas Elliott Muirhead, to which its design is attributed.&nbsp; As the son of the founder of Gowans, Kent and Company, John G. Kent (1861-1927) worked for the noted Toronto glassware firm prior to establishing a construction company with his son, Henry (Harry) Gowans Kent in the early 1920s.&nbsp; Apart from his business interests, which included his role as president of the Toronto Board of Trade, Kent gained prominence as the managing director of the Canadian National Exhibition (1920-27) and, in that capacity, was the first Canadian to head the American Association of Fairs and Exhibitions.&nbsp; Thomas Elliott Muirhead (1890-1961) is best known for his role as the architect for the John G. Kent Construction Company.&nbsp; With few extant projects remaining in Toronto, the Kenson Apartments (1927) at 51 Grosvenor Street and the National Cast Register Company Building (1935) at 222 Lansdowne Avenue are other recognized heritage properties designed by Muirhead.
The King Building is also linked to Toronto&rsquo;s famed Malabar Costumes Company (now known as Malabar Limited), which acquired the property in 1930 and expanded and occupied the premises until 1956.&nbsp; Founded in Winnipeg in the early 20th century, Henry V. Mallabar (sic) opened the enterprise&rsquo;s Toronto branch in 1923 where the company manufactured and rented costumes to clients ranging from individuals to both amateur and professional companies across North America.&nbsp; In its King Street location, Malabar Limited unveiled its renowned opera department and, by 1950, described itself as &ldquo;the leading costume house in Canada, providing costumes for theatrical/musical productions and masquerade galas.&rdquo;
Contextually, the property at 305 King Street West supports the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it evolved from its origins in the 1800s as an institutional and residential enclave to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing century during the first half of the 20th century.&nbsp; The King Building contributes to the surviving collection of recognized heritage buildings from all phases of the development of King-Spadina.&nbsp; With its location on the south side of King Street between John Street and Blue Jays Way (originally Peter Street), the King Building is part of an important block that includes Hughes Terrace (former residential buildings dating to the 1850s), the Westinghouse Building (a warehouse constructed in two phases between 1927 and 1935), and a collection of late-19th century commercial buildings that are designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the King Building at 305 King Street West are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the south side of King Street West between John Street and Blue Jays Way
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey rectangular-shaped plan
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and metal detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the cornice with the corbelled brackets on the north elevation facing the street
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation where the first (ground) floor storefront has stone detailing (the openings have been altered)
-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north elevation, the second storey with the three window openings (the centre opening is larger) with the stone sills and the brick flat arches
Note: the east side elevation, which is viewed from King Street West, has flat-headed window openings.&nbsp; The west side elevation adjoins the neighbouring building at 315 King Street.&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation and wings are not identified as heritage attributes.

1906,Proposed Amendments to the City of Toronto Municipal Code for Increases to the Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Certain Water and Wastewater Service Fees ,,2020-11-06 05:00:00,"Notice is hereby given that City officials are recommending to Toronto City Council the enactment of a by-law, effective January 1, 2021, amending the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, and any other necessary Municipal Code Chapters as may be required, to:
-&nbsp; increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers;
-&nbsp; increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees;
As shown in Appendix A (attached below), the recommended increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective January 1, 2021, are as follows:
-&nbsp; for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate &nbsp;and the Block 2 Rate by 1.5%; and-&nbsp; for flat rate consumers, all rates by 1.5%.
The proposed increases to water and wastewater service fees, effective January 1, 2021, are shown in Appendix B (attached).
City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.
The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, are set out in the report to the Budget Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and the General Manager, Toronto Water entitled ""2021 Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees "" (the ""Report"").
The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2021 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.415 billion, which is fully funded from the 2021 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services.
The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services.

80 Queen's Park - The Edward Johnson Building
Reasons for Designation
The property 80 Queen's Park is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The property at 80 Queen's Park contains the Edward Johnson building which was constructed in 1960-1961 to house the University of Toronto's Faculty of Music.&nbsp; The five-storey brick and concrete building, which was designed by one of Canada's leading Modernist firms, Gordon S. Adamson Associates architects is representative of Late Modernism.&nbsp; Situated behind Wymilwood (later known as Falconer Hall) on the edge of the bank overlooking the former Taddle Creek Ravine, the building faces Queen's Park and the lower level Philosophers Walk.&nbsp; Named for Edward Johnson, a tenor at the New York Metropolitan Opera and Board Member, it contains two concert halls, one for opera with the requisite fly tower and named for Sir Ernest MacMillan, the renowned composer and Dean of the Faculty of Music (1927-1952) and a chamber hall, known as Walter Hall.&nbsp; The building was extended in 1988 by Moffatt, Kinoshita and Associates Inc. with a double-storey underground music library whose western elevation opens to Philosopher's Walk.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The Edward Johnson Faculty of Music Building has design and physical value as a very fine representative of the Late Modernism style which is expressed in its integration and reinterpretation of traditional and modern elements and its response to context and landscape.&nbsp; The building is designed to sit on a raised podium and features a double-storey colonnade, which is set before a curtain wall fa&ccedil;ade, surrounds the building on its principal three facades, and is evocative of a historic classical archetype used to distinguish important public buildings. Above the colonnade, the traditional pediment is replaced by a brick clad cruciform volume, originally containing the library, cantilevering over the colonnade with windows in its base. The modernist form-follows-function motto is present in the frank expression of the opera hall's fly tower on the northern end of the building and the combination of concrete with a textured surface and brick is characteristic of the humanism that infused Post-World War II Modernism.&nbsp; The colonnade responds to the context of the adjacent historic Flavelle House with its portico of double-storey columns.&nbsp; The darker red brick with the light-coloured concrete corresponds to the brick and stone cladding of both Flavelle House and Wymilwood (Falconer Hall).&nbsp; Located on the edge of the Taddle Creek ravine, the building design responds to the context as it extends its base two-storeys down providing a secondary entrance accessed by a bridge traversing the former river bed connects with Philosopher's Walk and provides a pedestrian route to Royal Conservatory of Music on Bloor Street West.&nbsp; The 1988 addition, concealed beneath the lawn between the Edward Johnson Building and the Faculty of Law and Flavelle House continued this approach in its respect for existing context and in its relationship with the ravine and Philosophers' Walk as a flanked of sloping glazing permits views to the ravine and light to the lower levels of the music library.
The interior of the Edward Johnson Building has design and physical value which is evident in its double volume, brick-clad and concrete detailed lobby, lit by two monumental skylights as well as in the chamber music venue, Walter Hall which is considered to be one of ""Toronto's finest small auditoriums.""[1] &nbsp;&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The Edward Johnson Building has historic and associative value as it is named for and associated with Edward Johnson (1878-1959) a Canadian opera tenor who was the lead tenor at the world-renowned La Scala in Milan (1912-1917) before joining the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1922-1935) where he later acted as the General Manager of the Opera (1935-1950) Johnson also served on the University of Toronto's Board of Governors and as the Chairman of the Board of the Royal Conservatory of Music.&nbsp;
The opera hall in the building is also associated with Sir Ernest MacMillan (1893-1970) ""one of the major figures in Canada's musical history, Macmillan influenced virtually all facets of the country's musical life both by his precocity and by his tireless activities on behalf of education.""&nbsp; As well as being a child prodigy organ player and composer with a D MUS from Oxford, from 1927-1952 MacMillan was Dean of the Faculty of Music, served as Principal of the Toronto Conservatory of Music, was the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Mendelsohn Choir. He founded the Canadian Music Council, the Canadian Music Centre and was a founding member of the Canada Council. He was knighted in 1935 and became a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1970.
The second concert hall for chamber music is associated with Arnold Walter (1902-1973), a ""visionary and influential leader of music education""[2] who brought the Faculty of Music international renown and established one of the most comprehensive music libraries in North America. He became a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1971.
The building is the first dedicated faculty of music building in Canada.&nbsp; It is associated with the University of Toronto and the Faculty of Music which was founded by the University in 1843 and has in partnership with the Royal Conservatory of Music been instrumental in the teaching of music as well as the promotion of its appreciation and the nurturing of many great talents.&nbsp; It was the first Canadian university to establish a musicology department in 1954, was the second school in North America to have an electronic recording studio established in 1959, promoted ethnomusicology in the 1970s and from the 1950s, through the UofT Press, published extensively on Canadian music.&nbsp; The music library contains the largest music research collection in Canada.
The Edward Johnson Building is valued as it is associated with the important Canadian architectural practise known as Gordon Adamson and Associates (now Adamson Associates) which was founded in 1946 by Gordon Sinclair Adamson (1904-1986) and is credited with advancing Canadian modernism after World War II.&nbsp; The practise undertook a wide range of building types including the Savoy Plaza mid-rise apartment block (1951, Massey Medal recipient), the Redpath Sugar Refinery (1957, listed on the City's Heritage Inventory) and the E J Pratt Library at Victoria College, University of Toronto, (1960, OAA winner of 25-year Award in 1996) as well as numerous commercial buildings in Toronto and institutional buildings across the province.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following Adamson's retirement in 1971 the practice continued to expand and grow with large projects in Toronto including Toronto Pearson International Airport redevelopment, Medical and Related Sciences (MaRS) Centre as well as commissions in partnership with internationally renowned practices in New York, London, Kuala Lumpur for which the firm has received multiple awards including one for the record-breaking Petronas Towers, the 2004 recipient of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture).&nbsp; The Edward Johnson Building is representative of a mature phase in the development of the firm's body of work as it combines the influences of post-war modernism evident in the work of Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto in a fitting design for a high-profile university faculty building with two public performance spaces, that responds sensitively to historic and landscape contexts.&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The Edward Johnson Building has contextual value as it defines and supports the character of this north section of the University Grounds facing Queen's Park which reflect 130 years of evolving character and development.&nbsp; Originally subdivided for development with grand residential estates, the area flanking the east and west sides of Queen's Park from the 1890s began to include university buildings, such as Victoria College, 1892, and institutional buildings such as the Royal Ontario Museum from 1913 alongside the residential estate buildings constructed in 1901-2 like Flavelle House and Wymilwood which were later adapted for university uses. The Edward Johnson Building represents the increased development of the area in the 1950s and 1960s with the first addition to Flavelle House for the Faculty of Law and of institutional buildings such as the McLaughlin Planetarium (1966-8) and the Gardiner Museum (1984).&nbsp; Its form and massing support the low-rise character of the adjacent residential and institutional buildings.&nbsp;
The Edward Johnson Building is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings. Its physical link is evident in its location behind the two grand estate houses of Flavelle House and Wymilwood as it sits on the edge of the Taddle Creek ravine and extends down into the valley.&nbsp; Functionally, it contributes to the cultural character of the area as it is both a performance centre with its opera hall and chamber hall as well as being educational as the university's Faculty of Music. Visually it is linked to its surroundings as its low-rise form complements the adjacent buildings.&nbsp; Its modernist style represents the 1960s, a significant period in the growth and development of this north section of Queen's Park while its materials and details such as the colonnade and dark red brick are complementary to the adjacent historic estate houses of Flavelle House and Wymilwood. With its lower level access to and bridge across the Taddle Creek Ravine to Philosopher's Walk and its pedestrian link to the Royal Conservatory of Music, the building enhances one of the great natural landscapes of the university campus.&nbsp; As part of the 130 year evolution of this area, it is historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;

84 Queen's Park &ndash; Wymilwood (Falconer Hall)
Reasons for Designation
The property at 84 Queen's Park, containing the house known as Wymilwood and later as Falconer Hall, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
Wymilwood, later known as Falconer Hall, was built in 1902-3 on the west side of Queen's Park, on land leased from the University of Toronto, by the financier and philanthropist, Edward Rogers Wood.&nbsp; Designed by the architects Sproatt &amp; Rolph, the two-and-half-storey house, on a raised basement, clad in red brick with stone trim, is representative of the Arts and Crafts manner of domestic architecture with its asymmetrical massing, multiple gable roofs, bay windows and prominent clusters of chimneys.&nbsp; The interiors are noteworthy for their finely designed and detailed rooms and for murals attributed to Gustav Hahn.
The house was extended to include a wing constructed on the south-west corner (1908), and a single-storey solarium (or music room) on the south-east corner (1914).&nbsp; Following Edward and Agnes Euphemia Wood's donation of the house to Victoria University in 1925, and with a donation from Lady Flavelle, a single-storey extension on the north-west to accommodate a cafeteria and other functions was added when it was adaptively re-used as a university women's residence, social and athletic centre.&nbsp; It was subsequently owned by the University of Toronto in 1949 and its name changed to Falconer Hall in 1952.&nbsp; It was occupied by the newly-created York University in 1960-61.&nbsp; From 1972 it has been occupied by the University of Toronto's Faculty of Law.&nbsp; Facing Queen's Park and located between Sir Joseph Flavelle's former house, Holwood, (1901) to the south, the McLaughlin Planetarium and the Royal Ontario Museum to the North and the Edward Johnson Building to the west, the house is part of the rich architectural and cultural history of this section of the University of Toronto campus and contributes to the evolving sequence the grand thoroughfare of University Avenue and Avenue Road.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
Wymilwood is valued as an example of the grand residential houses built on this section of the ""University Grounds"" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, first characterizing this side of Queen's Park prior to its development as a university and cultural precinct.&nbsp; In its massing and details the house is an excellent example of a design which incorporates Arts and Crafts principles cloaking them in Elizabethan detail and the influence of the Edwardian period.&nbsp; The two-and-a-half storey house reveals the Arts and Crafts sensibility as it is composed with complex asymmetrical massing consisting of multiple projecting bays and bay windows, steeply projecting gable roofs and tall clusters of chimneys terminated by bands of decorative brick.
Clad in a deep red brick with limestone detail, the Elizabethan details are present on the exterior in the half timbering of the gables on the south, west and north facades, in the stone details including the irregular quoins surrounding the windows, the profiles of the columns on the window bays on the south elevation, and in the styling of the rain spouts and in decorative details on the north bay window on the east elevation.&nbsp; The Edwardian taste for the Baroque is present in the pedimented door case with its pair of stone, Tuscan Doric columns surrounding a recessed barrel-vaulted entry loggia.&nbsp; The windows provide the informal variety associated with the Arts and Crafts in their diverse number of sashes and sizes.&nbsp; On the principal east fa&ccedil;ade, the inclusion of small multiple-paned sashes in each window unifies the elevation and is also characteristic of the Arts and Crafts movement.&nbsp;
The interior of the house has cultural heritage value as it is similarly eclectic in its design and detail.&nbsp; The Arts and Crafts is present in the large entry hallway with its fireplace and the winding stair, but the detailing throughout the interiors is classical reflecting the Edwardian period in which the house was built.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two fine examples of this are the Billiard Room which was added in 1908 and features Circassian walnut panelling and an elaborately carved stone fireplace and the solarium (music room) of 1914.&nbsp; The Elizabethan style is evident in the living room fireplace with the strap work and floral carving on the large hood above the recessed fireplace and in the octagonal panelling of the ceiling.&nbsp; The Art Nouveau, which was a popular style during the construction of the house, is contained within the small library and is evident in the stylized linear figures and decoration in two of the four murals attributed to Gustav Hahn. The floral carvings on the panelling and the cross-barrel vaulted ceiling which features carved plaster with fine floral and vine motifs are similar characteristics of the Art Nouveau and are also attributed to Hahn.
Historical and Associative Value
Wymilwood is valued for its association with Edward Rogers Wood (1866-1941) who constructed the house as his residence in 1902-3 and he lived there with his wife, Agnes Euphemia Wood (1868-1950) until 1924.&nbsp; With a reputation of being a financial genius, Wood was an important Canadian financier, the Managing Director of the Central Canada Loan and Savings Co. and a founder and Head of Dominion Securities in 1901 which, within two years of its inception, became the largest bond dealership in Canada.&nbsp; Wood was also the Vice-President of the National Trust, Brazilian Traction, Light and Power, Canada Life Assurance and the Canadian Bank of Commerce and served on numerous boards.&nbsp; Wood was a Methodist and a generous benefactor.&nbsp; With his neighbour Sir Joseph Flavelle, Wood was appointed a Regent of the Board of Governors of Victoria University in 1903.&nbsp; The following year, his wife, Agnes Euphemia Wood was appointed to the Victoria University Women's Educational Association. In 1905 the Woods donated $30,000 to convert Drynan house, at the south-east corner of Queen's Park as a women's residence, enabling Victoria University to accept many more women students. In 1925, Edward and Agnes Wood gave Wymilwood to Victoria University, and with financial contributions from their neighbour, Lady Flavelle, to adaptively re-use the house to provide a much needed women's centre for social, athletic and residential purposes at the UofT. During the First World War, Wood served as the Director of the IMB's Aviation Department, including the Curtiss Aeroplane branch plant in Toronto as well as leading the Victory Loan Campaign, the highly successful campaign to raise funds through bonds. Wood supported teaching programs at Victoria University, the YMCA, and the Toronto General Hospital.&nbsp; He was a founder of the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the AGO), served as a Chairman of the Board of Grace Hospital and was a Trustee of the Toronto Orthopaedic Hospital.&nbsp; Agnes and Ed Wood were among the private donors supporting the commission of the Gustav Hahn ceiling at St. Paul's on Avenue Road in 1901 and subsequently commissioned Hahn to do murals in the library at Wymilwood.&nbsp;
Wymilwood is also valued for its association with the UofT and York University.&nbsp; It was owned by the UofT from 1949 and re-named in 1952 for Robert Falconer who served as the fourth president of the UofT from 1907-1932.&nbsp; In 1960 Falconer Hall was, with Glendon Hall (the second Wood residence), the location of the incipient York University in its first years of its creation and from 1974 has provided additional accommodation for the Faculty of Law, located in Flavelle House.&nbsp; The house and its occupant have contributed to the rich history and evolution of the Victoria University and the UofT throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.&nbsp;
Wymilwood is valued for its association with the architects Sproatt &amp; Rolph.&nbsp; Henry Sproatt (1866-1934) and Ernest Ross Rolph (1871-1958) were the partners of one of Toronto's leading firms from 1900-1934 with a reputation for its range of commissions for residential, institutional, commercial and industrial buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice extended its influence across Ontario and as far away as Manitoba and Nova Scotia.&nbsp; Important projects included the Birge Carnegie Library, Victoria College (1908-10), Hart House (1911-19), Upper Canada College (1923-4), Canada Life Building (1930-31), Royal York Hotel (1927-29 with Ross and Macdonald), and Eaton's College Park (1929-30 with Ross and MacDonald) and the Ontario Hydro Electric Power Commission Building (1934-5) now the Princess Margaret Hospital.&nbsp;
Wymilwood is value for its association with the architectural firm of Carrere &amp; Hastings &amp; Eustace G. Bird Architects.&nbsp; The firm was created following the commissioning of the New York firm of Carrere &amp; Hastings to undertake the Royal Bank building in 1906.&nbsp; Eustace Bird, a Canadian who had worked in Toronto, was working in their office and agreed to be the local architect supervising the job and the partnership lasted from 1906-1916.&nbsp; Carrere &amp; Hastings were one of New York's leading architectural firms, championing the Beaux Arts architectural style best exhibited in their design of the New York Public Library.
Wymilwood is also valued for its association with the artist Gustav Hahn (1866-1962) who contributed the murals and carved ceiling plasterwork in the library.[3]&nbsp; Hahn was a German-born Canadian artist, well-known for his painting, murals and interior design, who contributed to the introduction of the Art Nouveau style in Canada and was influential through his teaching at the Ontario College of Art. He was commissioned to undertake murals at the Old Toronto City Hall, the Ontario Legislature Building and the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in 1906.
Contextual Value
Located on the west side of Queen's Park, Wymilwood, at 84 Queen's Park, is valued as it defines and maintains the character of this section of Queen's Park between Bloor Street West and Hoskin Avenue.&nbsp; Its domestic typology, complex massing, form and details, representing early 20th century house-form architecture, and its setting with lawns, trees and shrubs are of contextual value as they maintain the residential character which represents the early history and development of this particular section.&nbsp;
The house is situated to the north of Holwood, (1901-2) Sir Joseph Flavelle's grand estate, now adaptively re-used as the Faculty of Law and known as Flavelle House, to south of the Royal Ontario Museum (1913-2007) and the McLaughlin Planetarium (1966-68) and to the west of the Edward Johnson Building (1960-62) all of which introduced important educational and cultural uses to the area as it evolved over time.&nbsp; Wymilwood, in its many incarnations is historically and functionally linked to this evolution.&nbsp; Physically it contributes to the diverse architectural character and periods of its neighbours while contributing to and maintaining a low-rise scale and character.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 578 King Street West (including the entrance address at 580 King Street West) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The property at 578 King Street West (including the entrance address at 580 King Street West) is a narrow, rectangular-form building situated on the north side of King Street West between Portland Street and Spadina Avenue. It is a two-storey, factory-type building on a raised basement and contains Edwardian Classical style details. The building was commissioned in 1904 by Davis &amp; Henderson, printing and bookbinders, to house their new factory and was designed by the well-known Toronto architectural firm Burke and Horwood. The building was completed in 1906, and Davis &amp; Henderson continued to own and occupy the building until 1957. After the property was sold, it was occupied by various tenants during the latter half of the twentieth century, including Capital Findings Leather Ltd, Present-Ware Enterprises Ltd, giftware, and a restaurant.
The subject property is located adjacent to several commercial-type buildings, including 582-592 King Street West and 473 Adelaide Street West (directly west of the subject site) and 570-572 King Street West (directly east of the subject site), which are designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act.
The property at 578 King Street West was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in May 2005. The property is located in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District.[1]
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 578 King Street West has design and physical value as a representative example of factory-type building with Edwardian Classical style details. The long rectangular form and massing, two-storey scale, and rear (north) elevation with its raised loading bay entrance, chimney, and six segmental-arch windows of varying sizes with stone sills in the first- and second-storeys and the one flat-headed window and stone sill in the third-storey, are characteristic features of the factory building type. Also representative of this building type are the presence of regularly spaced window openings that let ample light into the interior, with four flat-headed windows at the raised-basement level with stone lintels, five segmental-arch windows in the first-storey with stone sills, and five elliptical-arch windows in the second-storey with stone sills and paired-arch wooden frames. Elements of the Edwardian Classical style are evident in the mixture of brick and stone cladding and in the symmetry of the arrangement of window openings in the principal (south) elevation. The style is further evident in the six brick pilasters that articulate the division of five bays, which are chamfered at their base and terminate at horseshoe arches with triangular arches in between at the roof level with stone coping, and in the ornamentation of the entrance in the southeast corner of the principal (south) elevation, which contains a stone lintel surmounted on a wooden door with a canopy containing dentil molding sitting on top of two corbels carved into scrolls.
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 578 King Street West has historical and associative value through its direct association with Davis &amp; Henderson. The business, which was started in 1877 as a manufacturing company that specialized in printing and bookbinding, has been in operation for over a century, and their purpose-built factory at 578 King Street West was owned and occupied by the company for fifty-three years. The property also has value through its potential to yield information about the development of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 1900s as an important industrial centre that contributed to Toronto's prosperity and provided employment for over 120 years.
The property has further associative value as it demonstrates the work of the prolific architectural firm Burke and Horwood. The firm practiced under that name from 1894-1907, and their architectural portfolio in Toronto was expansive. During the last decade of the nineteenth century and into the first decade of the twentieth century, the firm had numerous commissions and designed several types of buildings, including a number of factories and warehouses at the turn of the century. Many of these structures were fashioned in the Edwardian Classical style.
Contextual Value
The property at 578 King Street West has contextual value for its role in defining, supporting, and maintaining the early-twentieth-century industrial character of the area as it maintains the scale, setback, placement, and orientation, the material qualities, and the design patterns of the former factory and warehouse structures to its east and west along King Street West. Built between 1904 and 1906, and being located in an area that was the centre of enterprise and employment for over 120 years, the former factory building is physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to its surroundings and contributes to the identity of the King-Spadina neighbourhood. More specifically, the property at 578 King Street West is visually linked to the flanking heritage properties through its red brick and stone masonry, and through the treatment of window openings.

2100 Yonge Street
Reasons for Designation
The property at 2100 Yonge Street (including the entrance addresses at 2102 and 2104 Yonge Street and 8 and 12 Manor Road West) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The property at 2100 Yonge Street (including the entrances addresses at 2102 and 2104 Yonge Street and 8 and 12 Manor Road West) is situated on the west side of Yonge Street at the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Manor Road West. The property at 2100 Yonge Street contains a large two-storey commercial building with glazed storefronts in the first-storey and apartments in the second-storey. The property at 2100 Yonge Street was constructed in 1936-7 and was designed by the architect Benjamin Brown (1890-1974).
The property at 2100 Yonge Street is located in the Yonge-Eglinton Secondary Plan Area and the Midtown in Focus planning study area. It was listed on the City of Toronto Heritage Register on 2 October 2017.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 2100 Yonge Street has design and physical value as being a representative example of a &ldquo;Main Street Row,&rdquo; which is identified by its corner location, two-storey scale, rectangular form and massing, flat roofline, and the glazed commercial storefronts fronting Yonge Street with residential or commercial units in the upper floor. These elements are typical of buildings dating to the interwar era in North Toronto. The property at 2100 Yonge Street also has value as being a modest representative example of the classical style, with its fenestration in the second-storey, the symmetrically-placed tripartite, double and single flat-headed window openings, the dentil molding along the principal (east) and side (south) elevations, the continuous stone band course connecting the window heads in both elevations, and the recessed entrance set in a decorative stone surround in the side (south) elevation.
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 2100 Yonge Street has historical and associative value as being representative of the career of the noteworthy Toronto architect Benjamin Brown, who was among one of the first Jewish architects to sustain a successful practice in Toronto during the first decades of the twentieth century. Brown designed more than 200 buildings throughout his career, many of which were in the Art Deco style, although he used various styles, including Georgian, Craftsman, Colonial Revival, Tudor, and Romanesque elements. The modest classical details seen throughout the property at 2100 Yonge Street can be seen at some of the other buildings designed by Brown, such as at the Primrose Club Building (1920).
Contextual Value
The property at 2100 Yonge Street has contextual value for its role in defining, supporting and maintaining the historical mid-rise streetscape character of the thoroughfare on Yonge Street between Davisville Avenue and Blythwood Road on a prominent &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; in North Toronto. The building at 2100 Yonge Street is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on the northwest corner of Manor Road West at the south end of the continuous group of commercial buildings with a shared setback in the block between Manor Road West and Hillsdale Avenue West. It is also linked to the neighbouring property at 2106 Yonge Street, which was designed one-year later, and included the same buff brick masonry and stone cornice, although the one here wraps around the south corner and there are brick quoins at the corners.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 60 Queen Street East is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Queen Street East and Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood and directly across the street from the Metropolitan United Church (1872), the property at 60 Queen Street East is part of a grouping of buildings that includes an original house-form building constructed in 1848.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Completed by 1901, the property at 60 Queen Street East is valued as a rare example in Toronto of a late-19th century corner building with a turret, a prominent feature that marks an expansion to the original two storey building completed in the 1840s.
The property at 60 Queen Street East is valued for its association with prominent members of the medical profession, namely, Dr. George Herrick, Dr. James Thornburn, and Dr. James J. Cassidy, who lived in the residence for more than 70 years.
The residential and commercial typologies of the group, as well as their architectural styles, together contribute to an understanding of the character of Church Street in the late-19th to early-20th century, when these typologies and the professionals who originally owned them, settled along the desirable location on the east side of Church Street, adjacent to important landmarks such as St. Michael's Cathedral and the Metropolitan United Church.
The property at 60 Queen Street East, at the northeast corner of Queen and Church Streets, has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it represents the mid-19th and early-20th century residential and commercial character of Church Street and the surrounding area, along with anchoring the adjacent properties at 131-135 Church Street.&nbsp;
Within the context of a neighbourhood developed as a mixture of residential and commercial properties located adjacent to St. Michael's Cathedral (1848) and followed by the Metropolitan United Church (1872), the subject properties at 60 Queen Street East and 131-135 Church Street are valued as a collection with historic, physical and visual links to their surroundings for more than 170 years. The group is highlighted by the prominent location of the building at 60 Queen Street East where it anchors the northeast corner of Queen and Church with its distinctive turret. The latter feature is rare in the city, in general, and a landmark within the local neighbourhood, in particular.
Across the street from the open space flanking the Metropolitan United Church (1872), 60 Queen Street East is a visible, familiar site as viewed from the high traffic Queen Street streetcar
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the property at 60 Queen Street East are:&nbsp;
The setback, placement and orientation of the building, anchoring the northeast corner of Church Street and Queen Street East
The scale, form and massing of the red brick building (currently overclad with metal siding) with its three-storey height with Mansard roof on the west elevation
The materials with the red brick (currently overclad with metal siding)
The principal (west and south) elevations including the corner turret with its conical roof and main entrance directly below located in the left (north) bays and flat-headed window openings with stone lintels and sills in all three storeys
The arrangement and shape of the window openings, including the two windows at the second floor level that are currently overclad with metal siding
131 Church Street
Reasons for Designation
The property at 131 Church Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Queen Street East and Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood and directly across the street from the Metropolitan United Church (1872), the property at 131 Church Street is the only surviving example of the original pre-Confederation house-form buildings which once occupied the four properties at 60 Queen Street East, and 131-135 Church Street.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The existing structure is valued as a rare surviving example in the City of a pre-1850 house-form building. Completed in 1848, the building is representative of some of the earliest buildings in Toronto. The Church Street facade included until very recently an original ogee-arched parapet on the northern bay containing an octagonal window. Though currently altered with brick infill, these features may be returned to their original state.
The property is associated with Angus Morrison, Toronto's 21st Mayor, for whom the existing 1840s house-form building was constructed and remained his residence for 15 years. Morrison was employed as a lawyer, a federal politician and served as mayor in 1875-1878.&nbsp;
With 60 Queen Street East and 133-135 Church Street, the house-form building at 131 Church Street contributes to an understanding of the character of Church Street in the late-19th to early-20th century, when commercial and residential typologies were constructed along the desirable location on the east side of Church Street, adjacent to important landmarks such as St. Michael's Cathedral and the Metropolitan United Church.
The property at 131 Church Street has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it represents the mid-19th residential and early-20th century commercial character of Church Street and the surrounding area, along with the adjacent properties at 133 and 135 Church Street and 60 Queen Street East.
Within the context of a neighbourhood developed as a mixture of residential and commercial properties located adjacent to St. Michael's Cathedral (1848) and followed by the Metropolitan United Church (1872), the subject properties at 60 Queen Street East and 131-135 Church Street are valued as a collection with historic, physical and visual links to their surroundings for more than 170 years.

Description
The property at 165 Stanley Avenue is a Collegiate Gothic style building that is comprised of five one- and two-storey structures that are interconnected and were constructed from 1926-76 on the south side of Stanley Avenue between Royal York Road and Elizabeth Street. The original building, which was formerly called St Leo's Separate School, was built in 1926 by Mimico Separate School Board with the assistance of the congregation of St Leo's Catholic Church. Several additions were made during the latter half of the twentieth century, including a southern addition in 1956-7, a southeastern addition in 1958, and a southwestern addition in 1963. These three buildings are representative of the Modernist aesthetic and they are associated with the architectural firm Horwood and White. Another addition was made to the east of the original building adjoining the eastern wall in 1976, which was designed by Stafford Haensli Architects.
The property at 165 Stanley Avenue was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on September 27, 2006 and was originally listed on the former City of Etobicoke Inventory of Heritage Properties.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The original 1926 portion of St Leo's Catholic School has design value as a representative example of the Collegiate Gothic style, which was popularized in Canada in the early-twentieth century during the interwar period and was frequently applied to institutional buildings throughout the city. Expressions of this architectural style are evident in the brown brick masonry in varying hues with stone detailing, including the imbedded stone plaque above the principal (north) doorway, the low-rise two-storey scale of the building, the horizontal form of the wing fronting Stanley Avenue, and the form and massing of the building, consisting of three-interconnected wings forming a U-shape and flanking a central rectangular massing. The Collegiate Gothic style is apparent in the projecting steeply-pitched gable entrance of the principal (north) elevation, which contains a central doorway and flanking flat-headed windows, all of which are ornamented with stone quoins. The same gables are repeated in the side (east and west) elevations at the northeast and northwest corners as well as in the rear (south) elevation. The style is further expressed in the stone lintels that sit atop the principal (north) elevation entrance and windows, the former being pierced by a pointed segmental arch and the latter by segmental arches, as well as in the stone sills. There also stone dripmoulds above the lintels of the doorway and flanking windows in the principal (north) elevation. Neighbouring the main gable entrance in the principal (north) elevation are flat-headed, multi-pane, windows on either side that appear in two groups of four. This window arrangement is repeated in the side (west) elevation to the left and right of a pair of flat-headed windows, all of which contain stone sills. An additional layer of ornamentation is visible in the side (east and west) walls below the gables, which consist of brick soldier course detailing with stone corners, creating decorative squares on the walls.
Historical and Associative Value
St Leo's Catholic School has historical and associative value through its association with the parish of St Leo's Catholic Church, which is significant to the community as it is the oldest Catholic church in Etobicoke and the only Catholic church in Mimico. The modest size of the original 1926 building is directly associated with the church having partially bore the cost of building and maintaining the school during the first half of the twentieth century.
Contextual Value
St Leo's Catholic School has contextual value as being important in defining, maintaining and supporting the historic character of the area that was the institutional core of the community northeast of Lake Shore Boulevard and Royal York Road. In this location since the early-twentieth century, St Leo's Catholic school continues to support the Catholic community in Mimico as both a cultural and educational centre. St Leo's Catholic School also has value for its physical, visual, and historical relationship to its setting in Mimico. It stands with other institutional buildings on the adjoining streets that contribute to and sustain the story of Mimico's development over 150-years and its sense of place today.

Reasons for Designation
The properties originally known as 41 Fraser Avenue, and now identified as three separate properties, 41 Fraser Avenue, 47 Fraser Avenue and 135 Liberty Street, are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp; The properties were listed as 41 Fraser Avenue on the City of Toronto's Heritage Inventory in 2005 and are located in Liberty Village which has been authorized for a Cultural Heritage Resource Assessment Study by City Council.
Description
The properties at 41 Fraser Avenue, 47 Fraser Avenue and 135 Liberty Street were originally known as 41 Fraser Avenue and also include the following entrance addresses at 39, 47a, 49, 49a, 53 and 53A Fraser Avenue, 38 and 42 Pardee Avenue.&nbsp; They contain the former E. W. Gillett Co. Ltd. factory complex, constructed in 1911-12 with later additions in 1922 and 1941-2. The complex contains a collection buildings,
1-4 stories in height with a five-storey corner tower, associated with industrial uses and featuring the Neo-Gothic and Streamlined Moderne styles.&nbsp; The complex is located in the historic industrial Liberty Village neighbourhood, on the south side of Liberty Street between Fraser and Pardee avenues.
The properties contain five buildings as follows:
135 Liberty Street and 53/53A Fraser Avenue, a four-storey, L-shaped factory building with a corner tower and a sequence of wings along the southern extension, designed in 1911 by the American architect S.

49 Fraser Avenue, a three-storey employee welfare building located to the rear of 47 Fraser Avenue, designed by the architect William L. Symons, built in 1922 and extended with an additional fourth storey, designed by Earle L. Sheppard, architect, in 1938. This building is an entry address for the property at 41 Fraser Avenue.
41 Fraser Avenue, a single-storey garage/storage building designed by the architect John M. Lyle and constructed in 1941-2. This building is part of the property at 41 Fraser Avenue and 39 Fraser Avenue is an entry address for that property.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Located in the heart of Liberty Village, a significant industrial centre in Toronto which developed in the early 20th century, the properties known as 41 and 47 Fraser Avenue and 135 Liberty Street are significant as they contribute to the early 20th century industrial character of the neighbourhood and also contain an unusual industrial typology in both massing and stylistic detailing constructed for the E. W. Gillett Co. Ltd.
The E. W. Gillett Co. Ltd. factory complex contains various structures which have design and physical value as finely crafted early-20th century industrial buildings which reflect the eclectic tastes of the period in their combination of both Neo-Gothic and Classical stylistic elements and one mid-20th century Streamlined Moderne building.&nbsp; The buildings are rare in both their composition, style and program in the City of Toronto.&nbsp; In the massing and distinct identity of functions the complex departs from the customary narrow rectangular factory building typical of late 19th and early 20th century factories, replacing the single volume with a cluster of buildings adapted to the site and expressive of the variety of functions associated with industry. &nbsp;These include the a-typical L-shaped factory building at 135 Liberty Street and 53 Fraser Avenue, which includes a series of small notches on its north-south leg and features a prominent tower at its north-west corner. While the Neo-Gothic style was gaining prominence during the early 20th century, its application at this factory with the crenellations and the raised parapets at inner corner of the L and the west end of L were unusual features which combined with the tower, have made this factory a distinctive landmark amongst its neighbours. The classical elements are present in the brick striations of the first floor and in the keystones on the tower windows and the piers, panels and mouldings of the tower.
The location of the offices in a separate building at 47 Fraser Avenue, was also unusual at this time and this structure features a single-storey portico with a crenellated roof, linked to the factory building at 135 Liberty Street by a bridge also with a crenellated roofline and brick striations on both stories providing visual continuity with the main building. The design of the two-storey powerhouse, at 42 Pardee Avenue, indicates its utilitarian function as the size and location of the windows, and the irregular rhythm of brick piers appears to have been determined by interior requirements related to structure and use. The current angled west wall at the north-west corner is the result of this portion of the building being reconstructed following the extension of a railway spur from the line on Liberty Street onto the property between the factory and the powerhouse.&nbsp; The employee welfare building, known as 49 Fraser Avenue, was designed in 1922 to match the adjacent office building in its choice of brick and stone, window openings and originally also featured brick pediments above the projecting bays at the outer corners of the east and west facades.
The single-storey garage/storage building at 41 Fraser Avenue is elegantly rendered in the Streamlined Moderne style with its striking minimalism, curving walls framing the deeply recessed garage entrance, horizontal brick banding, circular windows at the entrance and on the north elevation and minimally-detailed metal lighting fixtures.&nbsp; Although a departure in architectural style from the rest of the complex representing the shifting tastes of the interwar years towards modernism, as well as the evolution of the work of John M. Lyle, this later addition is complementary to the earlier complex with its brick cladding of the same reddish tone, stone base and trim elements including the striated brick at the entrance.
The former E. W. Gillett industrial complex has historic value as it yields information about the historical development of the Liberty Village neighbourhood from its earliest use as part of Fort York&rsquo;s Garrison reserve with its later 19th-century institutional uses to its development, following the introduction of railways, as an important industrial centre in the early 1900s which contributed to Toronto's economic development and prosperity.
The Gillett complex has value through its direct association with the E. W. Gillett Co. Ltd., which was established in Chicago in 1852 and manufactured baking supplies including Magic Baking Powder and Royal Yeast Cakes as well as Gillett's powdered lye and washing crystals, all of which were exported to the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa.&nbsp; The company opened its first Toronto branch on Front Street in 1886. Following the Great Fire of 1904, it relocated to premises at King and Duncan streets before moving, in 1912, to Liberty Village. In 1929 the company amalgamated with Standard Brands who continued to own the Fraser Avenue property until 1948 when it relocated to Dupont Street. The company's inclusion of an employee welfare building with a club, dining room adjacent sports fields in 1922 was an important step in providing for employee welfare which attracted the attention of the local press.
The industrial complex has further associative value as it demonstrates the work of the American architect S. S. Beman, known for his town-planning and industrial design work for the famous Pullman railway car company, and that of the prolific, Toronto-based architectural partnership of A. R. Denison &amp; Stephenson, and in particular, the firm&rsquo;s leadership in the use of fire-resistant mill construction for factories following Toronto's Great Fire of 1904. With the 1941-2 garage-storage building the complex is also associated with John M. Lyle, who has been declared to be ""one of Canada's outstanding architects of the first half of the twentieth century."" [1]&nbsp; Early in his career and with his foreign training and practice, Lyle was a great proponent of the Beaux Arts style and the City Beautiful Movement but through his work and writing, Lyle evolved, becoming a ""a proto-modernist""[2] who embraced the Art Deco and Streamlined Modern styles in his later career.
Located on the south side of Liberty Street, the principal traffic artery through Liberty Village, opposite the Lamport Stadium and fields, the complex of one-to-four storey brick clad buildings is important for maintaining the early 20th century industrial character of Liberty Village as it maintains the scale, material qualities and building typologies of an evolving factory complex. Built between 1911 and 1942, and having been a centre of manufacture, employment and enterprise for 110 years the complex is functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp; With its prominent corner tower at the south-east corner of Liberty Street and Fraser Avenue and its distinctive roofline crenellations, the complex is a landmark within Liberty Village.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the properties, formerly known as 41 Fraser Avenue and now also known as 47 Fraser Avenue and 135 Liberty Street which include the various buildings as outlined below, are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building complex on the properties on the south side of Liberty Street between Fraser Avenue and Pardee Avenue as this retains the relationship of the complex to its surroundings and the functional arrangement of its various building components which are part of its history and cultural heritage value
135 Liberty Street - 53 Fraser Avenue: Factory
The heritage attributes of the factory building on the south side of Liberty Street between Fraser and Pardee avenues are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the building, which represent its unusual factory design, and include a four-storey, L-shaped block with an angled corner at the north-east corner and notched upper stories along the east leg, and the tower at the north-west corner with the raised parapet at the crux of the L and at the south end of the east leg of the L&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials and their application which unify the complex and are characteristic of industrial buildings of the early 20th century include brick and stone.&nbsp;
Stone is present in the high building base, covered with concrete, the stone sills which extend into string courses and other decorative stone elements including the keystones in the window heads on the west elevation, the stone trim on the tower and, originally, the stone coping on the crenellated parapet.&nbsp;
Brick, which is laid in a Common Bond is the principal cladding of the structure and provides detailed elements including the striations of the first floor on the west and north facades, the soldier courses above the flat-headed window openings and in the decorative bands, the relief panels on the parapet and the elaborate detailing of the tower with its multiple pilasters of varying heights and relief panels.&nbsp; The brick detail demonstrates the high level of design as well craftsmanship that makes this an impressive industrial building and a contributor to the Liberty Village neighbourhood. Yellow brick is used to clad the inner side walls of the series of small notched bays on the north-south leg of the L and its use here is typical of the period when it was often employed on less important walls of a structure.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The design and arrangement of the window openings, which originally contained double-hung sash with multiple panes, is another means by which the physical value of the building is established as their variety adds to the richness of the design of the facades.&nbsp; These various types include the single, segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings of the tower, the flat-headed, single windows clustered in pairs at the fourth floor, and the mix of paired sash in a double-wide opening, and the former ""Chicago"" windows now with three panes in a triple-wide opening.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opening at the base of the brick tower and its stone surround which was a primary entrance to the complex, separate from loading bays and providing access to the stairs.
47 Fraser Avenue - Head Office - Administration Building
The heritage attributes of the head office building are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of two-storey building on a raised basement with a notched north-west corner, projecting entry portico and second-storey bridge connecting to the factory at 135 Liberty Street as they contribute to the unusual composition of the facility and represent the building's function as the administrative component of the complex and its integral functional and physical connection to that complex
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials include brick cladding, in common bond, with its striations, panel details and brick soldier courses, the stone base covered in concrete with stone details on the entrance porch and visually link the head office to the rest of complex, contributing to the design value through their carefully crafted details and application.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; Design value is evident in the arrangement of the principal (west) fa&ccedil;ade with its recessed, north-west corner adjacent to the main block with its classical composition of two, slightly projecting outer bays with single windows flanking the central section with its three pairs of single windows at all three storeys. The projecting entry porch with its crenellated roof line, shield, buttressed pilasters and segmental headed re-establishes the Neo-Gothic style. The south (side) elevation repeats this composition through the projecting end bays flanking a central bay, here, due to the shorter length of the fa&ccedil;ade, two single and two half windows mirrored about the central line in a classical manner.&nbsp; The east (rear) elevation with its pairs of windows flanked by two outer bays of solid brick and the north (side) elevation repeat the pattern of window types and arrangement of the west and south elevations.&nbsp; The east elevation does not have projecting outer bays.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The design of the bridge with its crenellated roofline, triplet window openings and arched underside complement the design of the office and factory buildings that it connects on either side.
42 Pardee Avenue - Powerhouse Building
The heritage attributes of the Powerhouse building are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey, flat-roofed building, rectangular in plan except for the angled west wall at the north-west corner an alteration that was made to accommodate the railway siding
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick cladding in English bond which ties the building to the rest of the factory complex
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The door openings and window openings which are single and double-height with segmental-arched heads with three brick courses and stone window sills.&nbsp; The double-height windows feature triple-hung sash with multiple small panes.&nbsp;
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick pilasters which flank the double-height windows on the west wall and the corbelled bricks at the north and south end walls
49 Fraser Avenue - Employee Welfare Building
The heritage attributes of building are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the flat-roofed four-storey building constructed on a rectangular plan and connected at the north east corner to the factory building whose design and fa&ccedil;ade arrangement is compatible with the administration building and originally also featured paired pediments at the outer corners which emphasized the bi-lateral symmetry expressed in the slightly projecting outer bays of the west elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick cladding, laid in a common bond pattern, and raised stone base clad in concrete and the soldier courses which act as continuous sting courses and lintels for the window openings and the notched layering of brick at the outer corners of the west elevation
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows are flat-headed with stone sills and their arrangement on the west elevation corresponds to the administration building with its paired opening in the outer bays and single openings in between further emphasizing the bi-lateral symmetry of the west elevations. The triple-width windows of the fourth floor openings are indicative of the addition in 1938.&nbsp; On the shorter south elevations, the windows are singles grouped in pairs or singles. The variation in the windows with single, double and triple widths corresponds to the window pattern of both the administration building and the factory building.
41 Fraser Avenue Adelaide Street West - Garage and Storage Building
The heritage attributes of the former garage and storage building are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the one storey building with a deeply recessed entry with curved walls on its principal west elevation which are linked to and representative of the building's original function as a garage/storage building for the factory complex
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick cladding which matches that of the original factory complex and which, with its recessed bands at the curved corners and in its common bond pattern, aligning with the recessed brick bands, contributes to the horizontal elements of the building's design
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone base of the building which ties in with the base of the original factory but whose shallowness corresponds to the low-rise and horizontal linearity of this garage/storage building
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The projecting light coloured band which marks the edge of the ceiling of the recessed entry and continues as a lintel over the two flanking windows, and with the stone sills, extends past the outer edges of the windows framing the end of the brick striations and emphasizing the horizontality of the fa&ccedil;ade which is characteristic of the Streamlined Moderne style
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The wide window opening flanking the recessed entry on the west elevation which contribute to the horizontality and with the adjacent expanse of unrelieved wall surface, the minimal quality of the building.&nbsp; These windows feature Chicago-type elements their wider central bay and two adjacent side bays with opening sections.&nbsp; The windows feature original metal factory-sash glazing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows on the north elevation with a combination of various types including the broad Chicago-type, narrower windows and those adjacent to a doorway which feature factory-sash glazing with opening sections and have stone sills and a continuous stone lintel reinforcing the horizontal emphasis
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows on the east and south elevations, with their consistent sill and head height, marked by stone lintels continuing as horizontal bands and stone sills, their factory sash glazing in single or Chicago-window type openings
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The large circular window opening on the north elevation and the south facing wall of the recessed entry which are expressive of the Streamlined Moderne's preference for geometric forms and have metal factory-sash glazing with a central opening section
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The semi-cylindrical light fittings on the north, west and south facades which with their linear copper frames are characteristic of the Streamlined Moderne style
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The two recessed circular light fittings in the ceiling of the entrance with their three thin bands.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 41 Spadina Road, including the entry address of 45 Spadina Road, and known as Spadina Gardens, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value
Description
The property at 41 Spadina Road contains the Spadina Garden Apartments, a four-and-half-story apartment building located on the south-east corner of Spadina Road and Lowther Avenue.&nbsp; Constructed in 1905-6, to the designs of the architect Arthur R. Denison, the red-brick clad building, with stone trim, is a fine example of Edwardian Classicism noteworthy as one of the earliest apartment buildings in Toronto.&nbsp; Spadina Gardens was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1979. Located in the Annex neighbourhood, the property is included within the boundary of the West Annex Phase 2 study area authorized by City Council in 2018 and is west of the West Annex Phase 1 (Madison Avenue) Heritage Conservation District.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1905-6, Spadina Gardens has design and physical value as it is one of the two, known, surviving representatives of the earliest Toronto apartment buildings, which were a new housing type in the city c1900 and reflective of social change and urban growth at this period. The early apartment buildings drew on established precedents in Europe, New York, Chicago, Buffalo and Montreal.&nbsp; The layout of the apartments at Spadina Gardens indicated it as a fair alternative to the adjacent Annex detached and semi-detached houses.&nbsp; The apartment layout was similar as it included a generous square entry hall opening to the public rooms which had enhanced flexibility and spatial flow through the use of pairs of glazed pocket doors between the main public rooms. It also provided discreet separation of public and private spaces akin to a house and unlike many contemporary apartment buildings. Early examples of the type, like Spadina Gardens, were built in proximity to the downtown on major streets in residential neighbourhoods, where their low-rise massing and complimentary architectural styles and material allowed them to increase density and provide alternative, affordable, rental housing options to the detached house.&nbsp;
Spadina Gardens has further design and physical value as an exceptionally finely designed and detailed example of an apartment house in the Edwardian Classical Style.&nbsp; The style is represented in the symmetrical design of the elevations, featuring bay windows and balconies supported on robustly carved corbels with wrought iron balustrades, the stone surrounds of the two principal entrances with their elliptical transom lights, complimented by the pairs of oval windows above and the prominent cornice with its decorative bands and dentil course. A high degree of craftsmanship is evident in the choice of cladding material and its detailing, including the red brick and purple brick employed in the rusticated base of banded bricks, the quoins at the corners, and keystones in the oval windows in combination with Roman stone belt course, sills and lintels and rough-cut stone cladding for the raised basement is further evidence of careful detailing and craftsmanship employed to convey the Edwardian Classical style.&nbsp; A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the architect's layouts for the apartments with their flow of space in the public rooms, the careful separation of public and private spaces. The layouts convey the comfort of a house-form building and its associated types of space including a generous entry hall and the provision of natural light throughout.&nbsp; Their success is evident in the fact that they have remained intact for more than 100 years and continue to function as originally designed.
The property has historical and associative value as it represents the introduction of a new housing typology to the City of Toronto c. 1900 that would address a gap in the housing market in its provision of rental housing for a wide-range of residents not easily accommodated in the predominant typology of the single-family detached house. With origins in the European mansion block, the new apartment buildings were constructed in proximity to residential neighbourhoods, and offered a housing option appropriate to the needs and incomes of spinsters, widows and bachelors, young couples, retired couples and families, enabling them, at various stages of life, to stay within their neighbourhoods. Along with Sussex Court, completed in 1904, and also developed by the brothers Alfred and James Hawes with designs by the architect A. R. Denison, Spadina Gardens is one of the two earliest known surviving examples of an apartment building in Toronto.&nbsp;
The property also has value for its associations with many important Toronto residents including Sir Henry Pellatt, Lady Pellatt, and Lionel Massey.&nbsp; The property was also the home for numerous individuals associated with Canadian arts, including Dorothy Stevens, painter and printmaker, Lois Marshall opera soprano, Samuel Hersenhoren, violinist and conductor on stage and radio, Maureen Forester, opera star, the musicians Irene and Bird Bailey, Maureen Whihak, designer for film, theatre and television, Ken Gass, founder, Factory Theatre, George F. Walker, script-writer, Member of the Order of Canada and Governor General medal award winner, Jacob Richler, author and journalist and David Young, author and founder of the Writer's Trust of Canada.
Spadina Gardens was designed by Arthur Richard Denison (1857-1923) a prolific Toronto architect who designed many buildings in the city and across Ontario including churches, institutions, residential buildings and social facilities and who specialized throughout his career in warehouses and mills and fireproof construction.&nbsp; Denison is further significant for his design of two of Toronto's earliest surviving apartment buildings, Sussex Court and Spadina Gardens.
Located on the south-east corner of Spadina Road and Lowther Avenue, the property containing the Spadina Gardens Apartments has contextual value as its Edwardian grandeur, displayed in its brick and stone details, four-storey massing located in a landscaped and treed setting, maintains and supports the late 19th and early 20th-century residential character of the Annex neighbourhood.
As a new residential building type representing social change, the growth of the city and increased densification, Spadina Gardens has further contextual value as it reflects this 20th-century evolution along Spadina Road, one of the city's main thoroughfares, as well as in the surrounding Annex neighbourhood. This evolution would include other 3-4 storey walk ups, the mid-rise apartment towers of the post-war era, as at 59 Spadina Road to the north, high-rise slabs, such as the 1966, sculptural Vincennes apartments by Uno Prii, to the west at Lowther Avenue and Walmer Road, and the later more urbanistically-conscientious blocks, like that at 50 Spadina Road, on the north-west corner opposite Spadina Gardens, which reclaims its scale and role of providing an urban street wall with its brick base of town houses.&nbsp;
For over 100 years, Spadina Gardens has been a landmark within the Annex neighbourhood. First prominent as an innovative building type associated with the major cities of Europe and the United States, its finely detailed architecture and massing, combined with its history of renowned residents have made it a well-loved focal point within the local community, as well as a well-regarded model of historic, architecturally fine, low-rise rental housing in the City of Toronto.
Heritage Attributes
Design and Physical Value
The following heritage attributes contribute to the value of Spadina Gardens at 41 Spadina Road as a representative of the first apartment buildings constructed in Toronto c 1900:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the apartment building at the south-east corner of Spadina Road and Lowther Avenue with its principal, west elevation facing Spadina Road, and its secondary, side and north elevation, facing Lowther Avenue surrounded on these two elevations with a landscaped setting including lawns, trees and shrubs
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey building, on a raised basement with a flat roof, as it is planned as a pair of contiguous T-shapes, with the top of the 'Ts' providing a formal face to Spadina Road and the legs of the 'Ts' having sufficient space on either side to allow generous provision of daylight to the rooms facing the rear of the property
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition of the principal, west elevation facing Spadina Road which indicates its function as an apartment building with its two main entrances which provide access to a pair of apartments on each floor.&nbsp; The entrances, flanked to either side by a long narrow window and a bay window are indicative of different hierarchies of space on the inside.
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition of the north, side, elevation facing Lowther Avenue which with its repeated windows from floor to floor and its inclusion of bay windows indicating the spaces containing the more important spaces of dining room and two principal bedrooms in contrast to the plain narrow windows for the kitchen and small bedroom
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The chimneys which are indicative of the inclusion of fireplaces within the grand public rooms of the apartments

Reasons for Designation
The property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
Located east of Yonge Street and occupying the city block bounded by Lake Shore Boulevard East (north) and Queen&rsquo;s Quay East (south) between Cooper and Freeland streets, the property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East (including entrance addresses at 33, 43, and 53 Freeland Street and 2 Cooper Street) contains a combined commercial and industrial complex that was commissioned by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) and completed in 1954 according to the plans of the Toronto architectural partnership of Mathers and Haldenby. The LCBO complex consists of the four-storey Office Building facing Lake Shore Boulevard East that is linked by an overhead pedestrian bridge and a ground-level truck-loading bay to the three-storey Warehouse to the south. At the southwest corner of the property, the detached single-storey building was designed as a garage, repurposed in 1958 for a retail store (replacing the outlet that was originally located inside the office building), and subsequently modified. The property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005. In 2016, the provincial heritage site was sold by the Government of Ontario.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design or Physical Value
The property 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East has cultural heritage value as a rare example of a combined provincial headquarters commercial and industrial complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was purpose-built for the LCBO and is comprised of a four-storey, rectangular-shaped, Office Building and a three-storey, rectangular-shaped, Warehouse. The components of the site are linked through a third-storey overhead copper-clad pedestrian bridge, which connects the south wall of the Office Building to the north wall of the Warehouse, and a ground-level truck-loading bay.
The property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East has value as a representative example of the Modern style. Expressions of this architectural style can be seen in the shared construction materials of both buildings, including concrete, buff brick cladding and brick, stone, and metal detailing, and in the fenestration, the use of symmetry, and the detailing in their entrances.
The property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East has cultural heritage value for displaying a high degree of craftsmanship through its functional organization of the individual buildings that are linked through their designs and materials and are physically linked through a pedestrian bridge, with copper cladding and flat-headed openings, and a ground-level truck-loading bay. They are also distinguished individually by their scale, fenestration, and detailing.
Historical or Associative Value
The LCBO Complex is valued for its association with the acclaimed Toronto architectural partnership of Mathers and Haldenby, which prepared the plans for the complex in 1950. Headed by Alvan Sherlock Mathers (1895-1965) and Eric Wilson Haldenby (1893-1971) and following its formation in the 1920s, the firm was recognized for the wide range of projects it executed, including its contributions to the University of Toronto's St George campus and the industrial complexes for Coca-Cola Limited across Canada. The commission for the LCBO's headquarters in Toronto was followed by Mathers and Haldenby's combined office and warehouse facility (1961) for Christie Brown and Company in Etobicoke.
The property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East also has historical and associative value through its association with the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), the provincially
-owned agency that, with the Liquor License Board of Ontario (LLBO), commissioned the complex. In operation since 1927, the LCBO consolidated its activities in this location with its office headquarters and the massive warehouse that included facilities for the distilling, bottling, and storage of its own brand of liquor. As the largest purchaser of liquor and spirits in the world, the LCBO oversaw its retail and distribution system across the province from this complex at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East.
The associative value of the property at 55 Lake Shore Boulevard East is also through its contribution to the transformation of Toronto's harbour and waterfront after World War II. Prior to this, in the early-20th century, the harbour and waterfront had been extended and modernized with dredging, lakefill, breakwaters, permanent dock walls, and slips that provided multiple points of access for water, rail and road transportation. The section east of Yonge Street was prepared for the impending opening of the St Lawrence Seaway (1959) where large tracts of land were acquired for commercial and manufacturing facilities, including the marine terminals on the Queen Elizabeth Docks (no longer extant) and the LCBO Complex Quay East, which led to the post-war revitalization of Toronto&rsquo;s harbour and waterfront.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the LCBO Complex supports and maintains the historic character of Toronto&rsquo;s central harbour and waterfront as it was expanded and modernized in the 20th century. Anchored on the east end by the extant silo of the Victory Soya Mills (completed 1948), this section of the harbour and waterfront east of Yonge Street is associated with the large-scale facilities that marked its post-World War II development and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The LCBO Complex is an important surviving reminder of the ongoing transformation of the central harbour and waterfront during this era.
The LCBO Complex is historically, visually, functionally, and physically linked to its setting where it occupies the entire block bounded by Lake Shore Boulevard East, Queen&rsquo;s Quay East, and Cooper and Freeland streets and was situated to access the water, rail and road links along Toronto&rsquo;s central harbour and waterfront.
The relationship of the property to its setting is demonstrated by the placement, setback and orientation of the Office Building and Warehouse, which are situated on the south side of Lake Shore Boulevard East between Cooper and Freeland streets where they are connected to one another by an overhead pedestrian bridge and a ground-level truck-loading bay. In this location, from which the LCBO oversaw its retail and distribution system across the province, the property reflects the commercial and industrial heritage of the area, along with the neighbouring Redpath Sugar Complex (1957) at 95 Queen&rsquo;s Quay East, which is also recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 100 Simcoe Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
The property at 100 Simcoe Street is located on the west side of Simcoe Street between Pearl Street (south) and Adelaide Street West (north) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; It contains a former industrial building that was constructed in two sections for Rolph and Clark Limited following the merger of two leading Toronto lithography firms.&nbsp; Toronto architect G. W. Gouinlock designed the south section (1904), with the architectural firm of Sproatt and Rolph completing the complementary north section (1905).&nbsp; From 1912 until 1951, the property at 100 Simcoe Street was occupied by Brown Brothers Limited, bookbinders and stationery manufacturers.&nbsp; The complex was modified for commercial uses at the end of the 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The Rolph and Clark Limited Building is valued for its design as a representative example of Edwardian Classicism, which was popular for industrial and other building types in the pre-World War I era.&nbsp; The subject building displays the features of the style, with the sombre red brick surfaces, the symmetrical fenestration, and the classical organization and detailing that (according to archival images) originally included elaborate cornices.&nbsp; The complex was updated in the late-20th century with the addition of the fifth storey, which complements the original sections of the building with the brickwork and the segmental-arched window openings that reflect the historic fenestration.
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 100 Simcoe Street is valued historically for its contribution to the development, evolution and regeneration of the King-Spadina neighbourhood during the 20th century.&nbsp; The area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904, which led to the merger of two leading Toronto lithography companies that occupied and expanded the industrial building at 100 Simcoe Street.&nbsp; Although King-Spadina declined after World War with the departure of many industries to Toronto's suburbs, it was revived in the 1960s when entrepreneur Edwin ""Honest Ed"" Mirvish restored the Royal Alexandra Theatre and adapted the neighbouring early-20th century warehouses for restaurants.&nbsp; In the late 1980s, the property at 100 Simcoe Street was converted from industrial to commercial uses as part of the ongoing transformation of King-Spadina.
The cultural heritage value of the Rolph and Clark Limited Building is also through its historical association with significant businesses in King-Spadina.&nbsp; After the Great Fire of 1904 destroyed the premises of the Rolph, Smith and Company, it merged with the rival Clark Lithographing Company as Rolph and Clark Limited and completed the complex at 100 Simcoe Street.&nbsp; Rolph and Clark Limited left King-Spadina in 1912 (prior to the company's amalgamation with lithographers Stone Limited as Rolph-Clark-Stone Limited) and sold the subject property to Brown Brothers Limited.&nbsp; For the next 40 years, Brown Brothers Limited operated its bookbindery and business stationery company at 100 Simcoe Street.
The Rolph and Clark Limited Building's historical value is also through its links to important Toronto architects.&nbsp; Famed practitioner G. W. Gouinlock received the commission for the south section of the building at 100 Simcoe Street after designing the headquarters of the Toronto Lithography Company (1901), a designated heritage property at 461 King Street West.&nbsp; The Rolph and Clark Limited Building reflected Gouinlock's ability to design high-end classically-inspired buildings, a skill that contributed to his subsequent role as official architect of the Canadian National Exhibition where he oversaw the early-20th century reorganization of the grounds with more than a dozen new structures, including several commemorated as National Historic Sites.&nbsp; The north section of the Rolph and Clark Limited Building was completed by the notable Toronto architectural partnership of Sproatt and Rolph as an early example of the firm's work.&nbsp; While Sproatt and Rolph had a personal connection to the project (Ernest Rolph was the son of Rolph and Clark Limited's co-founder), it demonstrated the architects' dexterity in the design of a complementary yet distinguishable extension to the complex, and prefaced Sproatt and Rolph's success in designing other industrial edifices in King-Spadina and landmark buildings throughout Toronto.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property at 100 Simcoe Street has value through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it is part of an important collection of former factories and warehouses that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto's new manufacturing centre following the Great Fire of 1904 and, in the late-20th century, evolved into a commercial hub and the city's Entertainment District.&nbsp;&nbsp; With its location on Simcoe Street, the Rolph and Clark Limited Building anchors the east end of the King-Spadina neighbourhood.
The Rolph and Clark Limited Building is historically and visually linked to its setting on the west side of Simcoe where it extends along the block from Pearl Street to Adelaide Street West.&nbsp; The property at 100 Simcoe Street forms part of an enclave of surviving early-20th century industrial buildings northwest of King and Simcoe streets, including the collection of former factories and warehouses on King Street West between Simcoe and John streets and on Duncan Street, north of King, which are recognized on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register.
Heritage Attributes of the Rolph and Clark Limited Building at 100 Simcoe Street are:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the west side of Simcoe Street between Pearl Street and Adelaide Street West
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey building above the raised base with the window openings
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline covering the complex
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the building into the south (1904) and north (1905) sections, which are distinguished from one another by the paired openings on the north section
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The south section of the building, which extends eight bays on Simcoe Street (east) and six bays on Pearl Street (south), with the canted southeast corner
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the south section (east and south elevations), with the flat-headed window openings with the stone lintels in the first, second and fourth stories and the segmental-arched window openings with the brick voussoirs and stone keystones in the third storey
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The entrance on the east wall of the south section, which is placed in the northernmost bay (the eighth bay from the south end) and reflects the late-20th century conversion of the building from industrial to commercial uses
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The north section, which extends four double bays on both Simcoe Street (east) and Adelaide Street West (north), with the single bay at the west end of the north elevation with the entrance at the base (the entrance has been modified)
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the north section (east and north elevations), where the flat-headed window openings in the first, second and fourth stories and the segmental-arched window openings in the third storey have brick and stone detailing and are arranged in pairs (apart from the single openings in the westernmost bay of the north elevation)
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth storey, which was added in the late-20th century and extends across the north and south sections, with the complementary red brickwork with brick and stone trim, and the symmetrically-placed regular and oversized segmental-arched window openings that reference the shape and detailing of the third-storey openings
The window opening at the base of the southeast corner (which replaced the original corner entrance), the adjoining entrance opening in the southernmost bay of the east elevation, and the cladding adjoining the latter openings are not identified as heritage attributes.

Reasons for Designation
The properties at 938 (including entrance addresses at 940 and 942 King Street West), 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue contain a collection of buildings historically known as The Palace Hotel and Tavern or The Palace Arms and are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design and physical, historical and associative, contextual value and they are local landmarks.
Description
The properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are at the northeast corner of King Street West and Strachan Avenue. The building complex is anchored by the three-storey building at 950 King Street West, with a two-storey, rounded corner turret, four 2.5-storey semi-detached townhouses to the east 938-944 King Street West and three 2.5-storey attached townhouses at 95-99 Strachan Avenue. All of the buildings are fashioned in the Queen Anne Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque styles. The subject properties were constructed in stages over twenty two years from 1890 to 1902: 950 King Street West in 1889-90, 95-99 Strachan Avenue in 1897, and 938-944 King Street West in 1902. Frederick Henry Herbert (1865-1914) was the architect of all of the subject properties.
The earliest building constructed was 950 King Street West, a three-storey Queen Anne Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque style, brick- and stone-clad building. The original building was erected in 1870 and was owned by George White, a labourer, who operated the Palace Tavern in the building. The White family tore down the original frame structure and replaced it with a grander masonry hotel in 1889-90, which operated under the name of the Palace Hotel. It was designed by the well-known Toronto architect Frederick Henry Herbert. The property at 950 King Street West was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on March 5, 1984.
To the north of 950 King Street West are 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue, which are comprised of three 2.5-storey attached brick townhouses and a one-storey addition to the hotel. They were constructed seven years later in 1897 in the Queen Anne Revival style and Herbert is the architect of record for the townhouses. The properties at 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue were listed together with 950 King Street West on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on March 5, 1984.
To the east of 950 King Street West are 938 and 944 King Street West, which is the third phase of expansion of the building complex. They are comprised of four 2.5-storey semi-detached townhouses that are fashioned in the Queen Anne Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The properties were constructed for a Mrs Emily Morrison in 1902 at a cost of $9,000.00. Herbert was again listed as the architect and R. Chalkley &amp; sons was the builder. The subject properties were listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on June 20, 1973.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are valued as representative examples of the Queen Anne Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque styles. Both styles were popularized in Toronto during the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. Elements of the Queen Anne Revival style are evident in the presence of multiple chimneys, the rounded corner turret with a conical roof, the mixture of the flat-, round-, four-centred, and segmental-arches and keystones, the blind wall arches, the ornamental dentil mouldings and stringcourses, the carved corbels, roof crenellation, notched decorative window sills, the use of multiple cornicles, the gabled and hipped dormer windows, and the oriel window. The Richardsonian Romanesque style can be seen in the masonry, which is a mixture of brick and stone with rusticated stone lintels, sills, and skirting, the truncated brick and stone piers, and the round-arched openings.&nbsp;
Historical or Associative Value
The properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are valued for their association with the acclaimed Toronto architect Frederick Henry Herbert (1865-1914). Within a short five-year span of him establishing his practice, he emerged as one of Toronto's versatile and adept supporters of the Queen Anne Revival style. While he accepted commercial, institutional, and industrial commissions, he specialized in residential architecture and designed nearly 100 residential buildings throughout the city. His command of both the Queen Anne Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque styles for residential buildings can be seen in his elaborate designs of properties throughout the city, especially in the Rosedale, Annex, and Parkdale neighbourhoods.
The properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are also valued for their continued association with The Palace Hotel and Tavern. The first Palace Hotel opened in the 1870s and it began functioning as a rooming house in the 1980s, with the tavern continuously operating for over 100-years. The Palace Arms, as the properties became known sometime after 1968, were important buildings in the community towards the end of the twentieth and into the twenty-first century as they provided lodging to socially and economically disenfranchised members of the community.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are important in defining, maintaining, and supporting the historic character of the area. The properties are situated at the northeast corner of King Street West and Strachan Avenue, and they serviced what was once the centre of a thriving working-class neighbourhood throughout much of the twentieth century. While most of the surrounding industrial and institutional fabric has been demolished, the properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are surviving intact examples of this period of construction.
The properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to their surroundings, where the distinct corner turret and conical roof at 950 King Street West anchors the northeast corner of King Street West and Strachan Avenue. The neighbouring properties at 938 and 944 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue were strategically designed to remain sympathetic to the architectural style and form of the property at 950 King Street West.
The properties at 938, 944, and 950 King Street West and 95, 97, and 99 Strachan Avenue are local landmarks. They are situated on the prominent corner of King Street West and Strachan Avenue and have functioned as a visual entryway to the neighbourhood for over 100-years. The subject properties are meaningful to the community in that for some 40-years they have housed socially and economically disenfranchised members of the community.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 2946 Dundas Street West (including entrance addresses at 2948, 2950 and 2952) is located on the north side of Dundas Street West, east of Pacific Avenue, and contains a three-storey mixed use building with four storefronts at ground level and eight residential units above. The building, known as the William Rowntree Block, was completed in 1921.
The property is located within The Junction Heritage Conservation District Study Area.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 2946 Dundas Street West has design value as a fine example of an early twentieth century commercial and residential mid-block building in the Neo-Gothic style with Collegiate Gothic features, the latter more often employed for educational institutions than for Main Street buildings. Buttresses, parapet walls with embrasures and brown rug-brick cladding punctuated by sandstone sills, lintels and caps are indicative of the style, while the ""R"" carved into the four pilaster capitals refers to the original property owner, William Rowntree.
Historical and Associative Value
The property has historical value as it is associated with the development of the West Toronto Junction and its main streets during the area's most prolific period of growth, following amalgamation with the City in 1909. It has historic associations with long-standing local resident William Rowntree, who commissioned the building, as well as the nearby heritage property at 2881-2887 Dundas Street West (1901) that housed the Rowntree meat and grocery business, as well as the offices of one of the area's first politicians, Andrew McMaster.
The William Rowntree Block is also valued for its association with the Junction-based Toronto architectural partnership of Smith &amp; Wright, whose commissions also included the similarly Neo-Gothic styling of York Memorial Collegiate Institute (1929).
Contextual Value
The property at 2946 Dundas Street West has contextual value as it maintains this portion of Dundas Street West's late 19th and early 20th century Main Street pattern of two-three storey buildings with a mix of brick shopfronts with residential accommodation, monumental stone banks and post offices that characterised the West Toronto Junction throughout its early subdivision and development history.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the William Rowntree Block are:
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The placement of the property on the north side of Dundas Street West which contributes to its contextual value as this feature is representative of the early 20th century Main Street character of this portion of Dundas Street West within The Junction community
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building which contributes to its design and contextual value as they are characteristic of a local commercial and residential building and maintain the early 20th century character and scale of this section of Dundas Street West in the Junction
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The primary material cladding on the principal (south) elevation, which is brown rug-brick
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The roofline featuring a cornice in the central four bays indicated by upper and lower stone stringcourses and including four vertically arranged stone details, and the end pavilions feature a parapet wall with embrasures and stone trim
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the principal (south) elevation, the stone details including the lintels, sills, spouts and caps, including the four capitals of the pilasters with the letter ""R"" carved on them
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The ground floor shopfronts are framed in stone, with the stone above the two end shopfronts being stepped (currently stuccoed over at 2952)
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The principal (south) elevation organized into two end pavilions with paired, flat-headed windows at the second and third storeys surmounted by decorative brick detailing, flanking four central bays containing four symmetrically-arranged window openings with flat headings at the second storey and segmental-arched openings and decorative brick headers at the third storey.

2370,Notice of Intention to Designate - 3315 Midland Avenue ,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and 3315 Midland Avenue, City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",2021-05-19 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 3315 Midland Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 3315 Midland Avenue (George L'Amoreaux House) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp; The house was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Inventory in 2006 and prior to amalgamation was included on the Scarborough LACAC's Inventory prior to 1995.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 3315 Midland Avenue is located at the north-east corner of Midland and South Shields avenues, and contains the George L'Amoreaux House which is set back from Midland Avenue behind a 1960s commercial building.&nbsp; Constructed c.1875, the one-and-a-half storey farm house is built on a T-shaped plan with a gable roof, board and batten cladding and a raised stone foundation.&nbsp; The farm house and rear wing were extended over time, including the addition of an upper storey on the wing and verandahs on its north and south sides.&nbsp; A verandah on its principal (west) elevation was added c. 1900, but was removed between 2015 and 2017.&nbsp; Barns and outbuildings to the north of the house and laneway were partly demolished with the surrounding suburban development in the 1970s, with the remaining outbuildings being demolished in 2007-8.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The George L'Amoreaux house has design value as a rare example of a board and batten clad farm house in Scarborough and is fine representative example of a c.1875, one-and-a-half storey Ontario farm house which was extended during subsequent decades.
The house has historical value as it is associated with the Josue L'Amoreaux family, one of Scarborough's earliest pioneering families, descended from French Huguenots, who settled in the township, creating the village of L'Amoreaux and who built one of the first school houses in 1818.&nbsp; The L'Amoreaux family maintained their prominence by continuing to own and farm substantial tracks of land to the end of the 19th century and their early settlement of Scarborough is commemorated in streets, parks, community centres and a collegiate.&nbsp; This house is rare as the only known remaining structure associated with and occupied by the L'Amoreaux family as the school and other L'Amoreaux houses which survived into the 1960s-1970s have been demolished.&nbsp; The property has been identified as having archaeological potential in accordance with the City of Toronto's Archaeological Master Plan.
Situated on the east side of Midland Avenue at the north-east corner with South Shields Avenue, the L'Amoreaux property has contextual value as it maintains the 19th-century pattern of rural farm settlement in Ontario.&nbsp; With its set back and long laneway leading from Midland Avenue, an important 19th century side road, the house follows a characteristic rural pattern in its setting.&nbsp; In the early 1970s the surrounding farmlands were redeveloped with suburbs but the setting, orientation and presence of the farmhouse retains Scarborough's remaining 19th-century character and is historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of the George L'Amoreaux house are:
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Midland Avenue at the corner with South Shields Avenue
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The laneway from Midland Avenue to the house and the view from Midland Avenue down the laneway to the west (principal) elevation of the house
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The scale, form and massing of the one-and-a-half storey house-form building, encompassing a T-shaped plan with gable roofs and verandahs on the south and north sides of the rear wing
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The materials including the board and batten cladding, the shiplap and other wood siding on the rear wing and raised stone foundation of the house and its rear wing
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the west elevation, the arrangement of a central entrance with a door surrounded by a transom light and two sidelights, flanked symmetrically by two identical, double-hung sash windows with six-over-six panes in the sash
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the south elevation of the house, the size and placement of the pair of double-hung, six-over-six, sash windows on the upper floor and the single double-hung, six-over-six sash window on the ground floor
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the north elevation of the original house, the size and placement of the pairs of double-hung, six-over-six, sash windows on the ground floor and the upper floor and their storm windows
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the south elevation of the rear wing, the verandah
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the north elevation of the rear wing, the verandah and the two double-hung, two-over-two, sash windows on the upper floor
The following are not included as heritage attributes:
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The enclosure of the verandahs on the north and south elevation
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The three storey 1960s building at the south-west corner of the property

Reasons for Designation
The property at 2685 Kingston Road, the Scarboro Foreign Mission Society, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 2685 Kingston Road, the Scarboro Foreign Mission Society, originally known as the St. Francis Xavier China Mission Society Seminary, was owned and occupied by the Mission from 1923 until 2018.&nbsp; The property contains the seminary constructed in 1923-4 in a Georgian Revival style according to the designs of James M. Cowan, with later additions. It also contains the Gothic Revival style chapel and adjacent office-residence wing designed by James H. Haffa and constructed in 1958-9.&nbsp; Located in the Cliffcrest neighbourhood at the south-west corner of Kingston Road and Brimley Road South, the Mission property is part of a collection of Catholic educational buildings located at this corner, including the prominent landmark of St. Augustine's Seminary, a designated heritage property, the St. John Henry Newman Catholic High School (originally known as the Cardinal Newman Catholic High School), the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Theresa Shrine Catholic School and the Chine Drive Public School.&nbsp; The property is currently owned by the Toronto Catholic District School Board.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1923-4, the St. Francis Xavier China Mission Society Seminary building has design value as a fine representative of the English, country-house type in the Georgian Revival style adapted and applied for institutional purposes as a seminary.&nbsp; The characteristic features of the type are expressed in the long, rectangular form of the flat-roofed, two-storey building on a raised basement, and in the design of the principal north elevation with its projecting frontispiece and grand staircase and the bi-lateral symmetry of the arched fenestration of the two end bays. The Georgian Revival Style elements are present in the combination of brick cladding with stone details, the double-height pilasters, the symmetrical arrangement of the composition and the windows and the parapet at the roof line.
Cowan has also introduced an element of Italian Catholic Renaissance and Baroque architecture appropriate to the seminary building in the detailing of the frontispiece with its four pilasters supporting a pediment with a wider central bay and a tall arched opening flanked by two narrower side bays with smaller openings. A device frequently employed on Catholic church elevations, the arrangement finds its precedent in Roman triumphal arches.&nbsp; The current door case, which replaced the original entrance in 1939 is reflective of the contemporary Art Deco style.
Constructed in 1958-9 the chapel and the adjacent office-residential wing have design value as they represent the Gothic Revival Style and the Catholic chapel type. The style is evident in the steeply pitched gable roof of the chapel, the lancet shape of the window openings with their stone drip-mould hoods and irregular-sized stone blocks of their surrounds, the buttresses, the stained glass and the four-pointed arched opening of the main entrance.&nbsp; The niche to the east of the entrance also features Gothic elements with its cusped, stone canopy with trefoil cut-outs and the irregular stone blocks of its frame.&nbsp;
The chapel is representative of a Catholic chapel type with its steeply pitched gable-roofed form and stained glass as well as in the decorative reliefs and symbols including the saint in the niche, and the various symbols carved in relief in the row of stone tablets of the main north window, the shield with the crown and Greek Chi Rho symbol and the crucifix at the apex of the gable. Its adjacent bell tower with its flat-hipped roof, reminiscent of an Italian hill town and stone plaque with drip mould, incised Gothic arch with a crucifix and irregular-sized stone surrounds contributes to the typology.&nbsp;
The interior of the chapel is a synthesis of a mid-20th century Gothic Revival style with features expressive of the Catholic Faith and the tenets of the Missions.&nbsp; These are seen in the vaulted form of the ceiling with its corbel brackets supporting curved beams, the illustrations of the stained glass windows, the wood panelling, the use of terrazzo for symbolism and inscriptions, as well as to distinguish the hierarchy of the chancel over the nave and the use of pink marble with a book-matched gold marble as a panel behind the altar with a Latin inscription.&nbsp; The stained glass doors with square panes in tones of gold and yellow glass combined with Gothic Revival hardware further express the combination of Christian tradition with a modern sensibility.
A high degree of artistic merit is displayed in the 1958-9 addition of the chapel and office-residence as their composition and massing complement the original seminary building and responds to the topography of the site.&nbsp; Haffa created an impressive public frontage to Kingston Road by setting the chapel forward in line with the original seminary building and setting the adjacent office-residential wing back so that the long volume of the chapel with its high gable roof would be visible as one approached from Toronto and which with the addition of the bell tower created a picturesque composition complementing the original seminary building.&nbsp; The set back of the wing took advantage of the slope, reducing the impact of the building's mass, providing screening for the rooms, emphasizing the chapel as the focal point and allowing for a circular forecourt leading to the imposing stone Gothic porch.&nbsp; Artistic merit is also present in Haffa's use of materials, the mottled brick and stone trim which complement the original seminary building further creating a cohesive whole of the complex.
A grotto located on the north-east corner of the property, in a treed setting, also has design and physical value as it is a landscape feature associated with a Catholic institution. Constructed of round stone boulders, the grotto contains a painted blue niched with a statue representing our Lady of Lourdes and a kneeling figure representing St. Bernadette.&nbsp;
The property has historical and associative value as it was the first purpose-built seminary and centre for the St. Francis Xavier China Mission later known as the Scarboro Foreign Mission Society which was an outreach organization significant to the Catholic community. The Mission was in operation from 1918-2018 and was active initially in China and from the 1940s in other Asian and Latin American countries.&nbsp; Originally intended to spread the Catholic faith, the organization was active in supporting the poor with medical aid, food, orphanages, the construction of roads and housing, reforestation, the preservation of language and culture and the establishment of cooperatives and credit unions.
The design of the 1923-4 seminary building demonstrates the work of the architect James Michael Cowan (1880-1941), the official Architect for the Separate School Board, who was also renowned for his designs of numerous Catholic churches, including the Church of St. Vincent de Paul. This and several other commissions including 125 Bathurst Street, 1674 Dundas Street, 154 Shuter Street, and 34 Hazelton Avenue have been included on the City of Toronto Heritage Register.
The property is also valued as it reflects the work of the architect James H. Haffa (1894-1980) who designed the 1958-9 chapel and office-residential wing of the seminary complex. Haffa also dedicated his career to the design of hundreds of Roman Catholic churches and schools and in 1957 in recognition of his dedication, Pope Gregory made him a Knight of St. Gregory.&nbsp; Examples of his work, including St. Michael's Cathedral and De La Salle School, have been listed on the Heritage Register.&nbsp;
Located at the south-west corner of Kingston Road and Brimley Road South, the Scarboro Foreign Mission Society is important as it defines and maintains the institutional character of the former Lot 25, Concession B which also includes St. Augustine's Seminary, St. Theresa Shrine Catholic School, St. John Henry Newman Catholic High School, the Chine Drive Public School and the Resthaven Memorial Gardens located on the north side of Kingston Road on the north half of Lot 25.&nbsp;
First constructed in 1923-4, the Scarboro Mission Society complex is historically and functionally linked to its surroundings as it is forms part of the historic evolution of Lot 25 as an institutional property dedicated to education and community outreach which was initiated with the 1909 location of St. Augustine's seminary and augmented with the addition of the St. Theresa Shrine Catholic School in 1952, the Chine Drive Public School in 1957 and the St. John Henry Newman Catholic High School in 1973.&nbsp;
Prominently situated at the angular corner of Kingston Road and Brimley Road South, the Scarboro Mission Society building complex with its set back from the road, tall-gable roofed chapel and bell tower flanked by the seminary, office-residential wing and its landscaped setting with trees and lawns is a community landmark, distinctive on the Kingston Road.

Located on the west side of Superior Avenue south of Cavell Avenue in Mimico, the property at 96 Superior Avenue is a 1.5-storey house-form building constructed in 1923. Built together with the adjacent properties at 98 Superior Avenue (recently demolished) and 214 Queens Avenue, this building represents one of two of the original three early-20th century stone cottages located in this area.
The property at 96 Superior Avenue was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2020.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property at 96 Superior Avenue has design value as a well-designed house-form building constructed in 1923 that incorporates elements of the British-inspired Cottage style with its symmetrically-arranged principal elevation and stone cladding. The property represents one dwelling in a fine collection of originally three stone cottages (along with 98 Superior Avenue and 214 Queens Avenue) that is unique in the Mimico area.
The property at 96 Superior Avenue, along with the adjacent property at 214 Queens Avenue, is noteworthy for its fine stonework with the split-faced, grey sandstone ashlar likely having been locally-sourced from the Mimico Creek. The use of this stone on all four elevations represents a unique instance of employing this construction method and materiality for residential dwellings in the area.
Historical and Associative Value
The properties at 96 Superior Avenue and 214 Queens Avenue, along with the recently demolished cottage at 98 Superior Avenue, are valued for their association with the prominent scholar and University of Toronto professor, Frederic J. A. Davidson (1870-1946). Since 1948, Davidson's contribution to the study of languages has been commemorated by University College in the form of the annual Davidson Prizes Competition for the best essays in English and French literature.
In addition to the original three stone cottages at 96-98 Superior Avenue and 214 Queens Avenue, Davidson built the large stone dwelling in the City's west end known as 'Brookwood'. The house on this property fronting on Royal York Road and backing onto Mimico Creek was demolished in 1961 but remembered as a local landmark.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property at 96 Superior Avenue, along with the adjacent property at 214 Queens Avenue, has cultural heritage value for defining, maintaining and supporting the character of the Mimico neighbourhood. Their appearance reflects the early-twentieth century development of the area as a model railway town at the western edge of Toronto, where local rail workers and manufacturers settled in proximity to their workplaces or commuter lines.
The properties at 96 Superior Avenue and 214 Queens Avenue are valued for their visual and historical links to the history of Mimico, from its origins as a community linked to the railway, to its development and evolution as an independent municipality. This unique, surviving pair of identical stone cottages dates to the area's earliest phase of residential development following its subdivision.

The properties at 96 Superior Avenue and 214 Queens Avenue are valued for their visual and historical links to the history of Mimico, from its origins as a community linked to the railway, to its development and evolution as an independent municipality. This unique, surviving pair of identical stone cottages dates to the area's earliest phase of residential development following its subdivision.

THE STERLING BANK
Reasons for Designation
The property at 260 Church Street, containing a former local branch of the Sterling Bank, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 260 Church Street is located at the southwest corner of Church Street and Dundas Street East, and contains a three-storey mixed use building with retail at ground level and residential units above. The building was originally constructed in 1913 as a local branch of the Sterling Bank and continued to serve as a banking institution until the late 20th century. A one-storey rear addition fronting Dundas Street East was likely constructed in the 1920s.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The building at 260 Church Street has design value as a fine example of an early twentieth century bank in the Edwardian Classical style. The steel and reinforced concrete construction is clad with red brick and stone, the latter materials being typical of period bank buildings in Toronto.&nbsp; The decorative stone and red brick detailing on the east and north elevations features grand, two-storey stone pilasters with fluted capitals surmounted by a stone cornice with entablature containing the words ""The Sterling Bank of Canada"".
Historical and Associative Value
The property is valued for its historic associations with the Sterling Bank, a chartered Canadian bank established in 1905 that expanded to over fifty branches across the Province by the time the current building at 260 Church Street was constructed in 1913 and before merging with Standard Bank in 1924 and, subsequently, the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1928.&nbsp;
The property also valued for its association with John M. Lyle (1872-1945), who has been declared to be ""one of Canada's outstanding architects of the first half of the twentieth century.""[1] Early in his career and with his foreign training and practice, Lyle was a great proponent of the Beaux Arts style and the City Beautiful Movement. The Hamilton-born architect became the favoured designer of the Canadian banking industry in the early twentieth century and would go on to design over 55 banks across Canada, more than 30 of those within Toronto. The property at 260 Church Street is unique within this collection for being the only Toronto branch of the Sterling Bank designed by Lyle.
Contextual Value
In its prominent position anchoring the southwest corner of Church and Dundas streets, the Sterling Bank building at 260 Church Street has contextual value as its scale, setback and style are visually and physically linked to the Garden District neighbourhood where it represents the early-20th century commercial character of Church Street's land development history and evolution.
Heritage Attributes
The heritage attributes of The Sterling Bank at 260 Church Street are:
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The placement of the property where it anchors the south-west corner of Church and Dundas streets, which contributes to its contextual value as this feature is representative of the early 20th century commercial character of this portion of Dundas Street West within the Garden District neighbourhood
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building which contributes to its design and contextual value as they are characteristic of a local commercial and residential building and maintain the early 20th century character and scale of this section of Church Street
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The primary materials cladding on the principal (east) and north elevations, which comprises red brick and stone
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The flat roofline featuring stone trim and a red brick parapet wall centred on the principal (east) elevation with its two flanking stone volutes
-&nbsp; &nbsp;The symmetrical arrangement of the openings on the principal (east) elevation, which is organized into three vertical bays with its centred main entrance, and four vertical bays on the north elevation with its slightly recessed western bay containing an intentionally-designed return of the upper-level stone stringcourses on the rear (west) elevation
-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the principal (east) and north elevations, the stone and brick details including the two-storey stone pilasters with their fluted capitals rising from a stone-clad base (with ceramic tiles currently affixed atop) and surmounted by a stone cornice with entablature engraved with the words ""The Sterling Bank of Canada"", the stone surround of the main entry, the stone window keystones and square corner stones, the stone stringcourse at the third-storey level, the brick soldier course lintels above all window openings and the raised brick, blank rectangular panel centred in the parapet wall
N.B. the one-storey rear addition fronting Dundas Street East is not considered an attribute.
Notice of an objection to the notice of intention to designate the property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 28, 2021, which is June 28, 2021.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 425 Cherry Street&nbsp; is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under 5 criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The property at 425 Cherry Street is located at the southeast corner of Front Street East and Cherry Street. The building is comprised of a three-storey structure fronting on Cherry Street, with a three-storey warehouse addition behind, extending along Front Street East. The building was constructed in three major stages - the two-storey Palace Street School, constructed in 1859 and designed by architect Joseph Sheard in the Jacobean style with an addition in 1869 by architect William Irving; the three-storey Cherry Street Hotel, constructed in 1890 incorporating the former school and designed by architect David Roberts Jr. in the Queen Anne Revival style; and the three-storey warehouse, constructed in c.1920.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 425 Cherry Street is valued as a representative example of an evolved building type and style, reflecting the evolution of the property from its early use as one of the city's early ""free"" schools, to a hotel, a warehouse, and a restaurant. The building contains representative elements of the Jacobean and Queen Anne Revival styles, the former being used for many of the first schools constructed by the Toronto Board of Education, and the latter a popular style in Toronto for house form and hotel buildings between 1880 and 1910. While altered through later additions, elements of the Jacobean style can be seen on the first two floors of the former school's west and south facades, including the use of brick cladding (buff and red), brick quoins at the window surrounds and at the building's corners, the symmetrical organization of the facades featuring central projecting frontispieces bound by large rectangular window openings; and the stone drip moulds over the south entrance and the second storey window above. The building's Queen Anne Revival style is evidenced in the portion of the building constructed as the hotel (at the corner of Front and Cherry Streets) and in the third floor addition above the former school, and include the mansard roof with dormer windows; the arched window openings on the second storey; the elaborate use of brick ornamentation at the second storey cornice; the large plate-glass storefront windows with sandstone details; and the Dutch gable with inset Palladian window opening. The three-storey warehouse addition features elements indicative of the warehouse building type, including large rectangular window openings with cast stone lintels and brick sills; a flat roof with brick parapet; and minimal architectural ornamentation.
Historical and Associative Value
The historical and associative value of the property at 425 Cherry Street resides in its construction as the Palace Street School (1859), its subsequent adaptive reuse as the Cherry Street Hotel (1890) it's later conversion for use as a warehouse for various manufacturing and transportation-related businesses (1920), and its having been the location of the Canary Grill, from 1965 to 2007. Originally constructed in 1859 as one of the early ""free"" schools built in Toronto by the Toronto Board of Education and the first free school to serve St. Lawrence Ward, the one-storey schoolhouse was designed by architect, alderman and future Mayor of Toronto, Joseph Sheard. In 1869 the structure was expanded to the designs of architect William Irving, a former apprentice in Sheard's office and a prolific architect in Toronto through the second half of the 19th century. The Palace Street School is also associated with Georgina Stanley Reid, an educator with the Toronto Board of Education who served as principal of the school from 1882 until its closure in 1887, and who continued to serve as principal of its replacement school, Sackville Street Public School (now Inglenook Community School), until her retirement in 1912.
Following construction of the larger Sackville Street Public School in 1887, the Toronto Board of Education sold the property to brewer, businessman, and real estate developer Robert Thomas Davies, who had the building converted into a hotel to the designs of architect David Roberts Jr. in 1890. David Roberts Jr. had previously designed much of the nearby Gooderham and Worts Distillery, as well as a number of hotels, including the nearby Dominion Hotel on Queen Street East, which was also owned by Davies. Robert Davies was an influential industrialist in late Victorian Toronto who owned a concentration of businesses along the Don River; he was the founder of the Dominion Brewery, and later owned the Don Valley Brick Works and Don Valley Paper Company Limited. The hotel which at various times was called the Iverson Hotel, Darcy's Hotel/Hall, Eastern Star Hotel, and Cherry Street Hotel, was a fixture within the Corktown community from 1890 to 1910, however its role within the neighbourhood diminished alongside the demolition of the surrounding area's residential character, the displacement of the neighbourhood's working-class residents, the relocation of the nearby Don Station, and the expansion of railway lines and supporting industries. The property was subsequently converted for warehouse and manufacturing use, and the three storey warehouse addition was constructed on the east fa&ccedil;ade of the building c.1920.
In 1965 the Canary Grill moved into the first floor, and became a well-known establishment within the area catering to those employed in transportation and manufacturing-related industries, as well as commuters. Through the latter half of the 20th century studio spaces within the building were leased to a wide range of creative and cultural tenants, including musicians, artists, manufacturers and cultural sector workers. In the late 1980s, the property was expropriated as part of the joint municipal and provincial governments' plans to redevelop the West Don Lands into a new neighbourhood, called ""Ataratiri"". The expropriation resulted in the eviction of many of the building's tenants, however the Canary Grill remained open until 2007, after which the building was fully vacated.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the Palace Street School / Cherry Street Hotel is significant in its relation to the former Canadian National Railways Office Building, located on the northeast corner of Front Street East and Cherry Street, and is part of a larger post-industrial landscape within the West Don Lands, which includes the Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Cherry Street Interlocking Station, and the Dominion Foundry Complex. The CNR Office Building was constructed in 1923, and is recognized on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register. The two buildings complement each other, with similar setbacks from the corner and with a common low-scale brick clad form. Together, the properties form a gateway into the West Don Lands neighbourhood, a mixed-use area constructed as part of the 2015 Pan Am and Para Pan Games, and form a significant landmark within the community.

2470,Notice of Intention to Designate - 103 Heath Street West,"In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario 103 Heath Street West",2021-06-30 04:00:00,"Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 103 Heath Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.&nbsp;
James Hobbs House
Reasons for Designation
The property at 103 Heath Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
Located on the south side of Heath Street, between Yonge Street and Avenue Road, the property at 103 Heath Street West contains a detached, red brick house-form building constructed c.1892-1893 that was first occupied by James Hobbs, whose family maintained ownership of the property for 50 years. Alterations largely executed on the interior of the original property in the 1940s were prepared by Toronto architect, Leo Hunt Stanford (1898-1970).
The property was included on the City's Heritage Register on March 10, 2021.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property at 103 Heath Street West has design value as this Late Victorian-era dwelling incorporates both Bay-and-Gable and Queen Anne Style architectural features with the combination of a two and a half storey bay centred rather than offset on the principal (north) elevation, decorative wooden bargeboards and brackets framing an attic-storey sleeping porch, its heavy stone lintels and a complicated roofline of hips, gables and window dormers.
Historical and Associative Value
The property is significant as one of the earliest surviving houses built on the portion of the street belonging to Plan 365 and dating from the 1880s-1890s.&nbsp; Over the past 130 years Heath Street has been developed with an unusual variety of residential dwelling types from a wide range of time periods that is atypical in Toronto. 103 Heath is important because it is representative of an early period in the planned land development of the street and the Deer Park community.
Contextual Value
The James Hobbs House stands as a defining property within a group of varied architectural types and styles on Heath Street.&nbsp; Its combination of Bay-and-Gable and Queen Anne architectural design and detailing set it apart from houses, townhouses and low-rise apartment blocks of later periods on the street. Representing the earliest period of the subdivision of Registered Plan 365, its built form is an important component in the history and evolution of Heath Street and the Deer Park neighbourhood.
The property is amongst the earliest houses built on this section of the south side of Heath Street West in the late 19th century, representing a period from the earliest point in the historical evolution of planned development on Heath Street and in the Deer Park community.
Heritage Attributes of 103 Heath Street West
The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the south side of Heath Street West between Deer Park Crescent and Oriole Road
The scale, form and massing of the two and a half storey plan on a raised foundation
The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing
The complicated roofline with hips, gables and window dormers, and the two red brick chimneys
The principal (north) elevation of the building, which is organized into three bays with stringcourse between the first and second storeys
On the principal (north) elevation, the centred two storey bay surmounted by an attic-storey porch with its decorative wood framing, detailing and shingling in the gable
On the east and west elevations, the decorative wood detailing in the roof dormer gables
The arrangement of the door and window openings on the principal (north), west and east elevations, their type (flat-headed or round-arched) and the stone lintels and sills
The decorative red brick drip moulds and voussoired headers above the round-arched window openings on the west and principal (north) elevations

Traders Building
Reasons for Designation
The property located at 625 Church Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
Located on the east side of Church Street between Charles Street and Isabella Street, the property at 625 Church Street known as the Traders Building contains a six storey plus penthouse office building built in 1956 and designed in the Neo-Georgian style by the architectural firm of Marani &amp; Morris. Constructed as the headquarters for the Traders Finance Corporation and its numerous subsidiaries, the brick clad building with cast stone detailing is part of the Church and Bloor neighbourhood, an area whose context is defined by the presence of pre- and post-World War II office buildings, many built for insurance companies and designed by Marani &amp; Morris.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
Built as the headquarters for the Traders Finance Corporation and designed by the architectural firm of Marani &amp; Morris in 1956, the Traders Building at 625 Church Street is valued as a fine example of a mid-20th century office building designed in the Neo-Georgian architectural style. This architectural style is emblematic of the firm's commissions through the 1930s to 1950s, and is a conservative classical style that responded to the emerging modern architectural movement often employed for institutional and corporate commissions. Features of the Traders Building reflective of this style include the tripartite organization of the building's facades with a distinct base, shaft and capital; the use of brick and ashlar cast stone cladding; and the regular rhythm of fenestration, including the window openings set within cast stone frames and inset from the fa&ccedil;ade.
Historic and Associative Value
The Traders Building is reflective of the work of the architectural firm Marani &amp; Morris, one of Toronto's leading 20th century modern architectural practices. Comprised of a partnership between Ferdinand Herbert Marani and Robert Schofield Morris, the firm was a leading proponent of conservative modernism in the mid-20th century, responsible for numerous high quality projects for institutional and corporate clients. The Traders Building is emblematic of the firm's high quality - albeit non-controversial and conservative - work, with a decidedly modern massing and form that remains steeped in the principles of classicism and an honesty of materials. The Traders Building was one of the last designs produced by the firm before Robert Morris received the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1958, and the promotion of Marvin Francis Allan to partner in 1959. The firm continues to practice today as RDHA.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the Traders Building at 625 Church Street maintains and supports the character of the Church and Bloor neighbourhood, defined by a collection of mid-20th century office buildings, many built for insurance companies and designed by Marani &amp; Morris. The Traders Building is historically linked with buildings located within the neighbourhood, including the Confederation Life, Manufacturers Life, and Crown Life Insurance Buildings, and is visually linked to the Crown Life Building, located at 120 Bloor Street East at the northwest corner of Church Street.
Heritage Attributes
Design or Physical Value
Attributes that contribute to the value of the property at 625 Church Street as representative of the Neo-Georgian architectural style include:
-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 6 storey plus penthouse office building, situated on the east side of Church Street and occupying the full block from Charles Street East to Hayden Street-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) fa&ccedil;ade, with a central bay projecting as a shallow frontispiece on the ground floor-&nbsp;&nbsp; The symmetrical and tripartite organization of the principal (west) fa&ccedil;ade, comprised of a distinct base, shaft and capital, and which is, in part, carried through on the rear (east) facade-&nbsp;&nbsp; The shared design of the two side (north and south) facades-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback of the principal and side facades from the sidewalk, which varies on each fa&ccedil;ade and permits plantings on both the west and south facades-&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of brick (red brick laid in Flemish bond) and cast stone cladding-&nbsp;&nbsp; The protruding cast stone entrance bay, including the black granite panels on either side of the aluminum door frame and that extend into the entrance vestibule-&nbsp;&nbsp; The building name - ""Traders Building"" - engraved within the cast stone entrance bay on the principal fa&ccedil;ade and centered above the main entrance-&nbsp;&nbsp; The regular rhythm of fenestration, comprised of rectangular window openings set within cast stone window frames-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick pilasters on the side facades, extending from the foundation to the cornice-&nbsp;&nbsp; The brick spandrel panels between the pilasters on the side facades, accentuated with protruding header bricks-&nbsp;&nbsp; The cast stone cladding between the windows on the sixth floor, with a slight reveal below creating a strong shadow line-&nbsp;&nbsp; The cast stone cornice at the sixth floor

Reasons for Designation
The property at 685 Queen Street East, the Dr. John B. Fraser office and residence, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 685 Queen Street East, contains the Dr. John B. Fraser office and residence, a two-and-a-half storey, hipped and gable-roofed, brick-clad house.&nbsp; The property is located on the south side of Queen Street East, between the East Don Roadway to the west and Broadview Avenue to the east, in the Riverside section of the South Riverdale neighbourhood.&nbsp; The property is within the boundaries of the area identified for study as the Riverside-Queen Street East Heritage Conservation District.&nbsp; In 1902, the property was purchased by Dr. John B. Fraser, who commissioned the architect C. F. Wagner to design a combined medical office and residence which was complete in 1904. The property was occupied by Dr. Fraser and then by Dr. W. Ambrose Fish from 1906-1914.&nbsp; The Fleury Funeral Company was located here from 1916-1935.&nbsp; In 1938 the property was converted to a multiple residential dwelling with six units.&nbsp; It was purchased in 1976 by Riverdale Co-operative Houses Inc. who continue to own the property which now contains nine dwelling units.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Dr. John B. Fraser property has cultural heritage value as an early 20th-century example of the combined medical office-single residence typology, which is evident in the design of the house-form building with the prominent front entrance and porch on the principle, north elevation and a discreet side entry, set back from the street on the east, side, elevation.&nbsp; Constructed in 1903-4, the mixed-use, house-form building is representative of the eclectic Edwardian style which pre-dominated in the early 20th-century while maintaining strong ties to the Richardsonian Romanesque style popular in Toronto in the late 1880s-1890s.&nbsp; The Edwardian elements are present in the Tudor Revival half-timbered gables and the classical column on the front porch while the Richardsonian Romanesque persists in the overall asymmetrical composition of massing, steeply-pitched, hipped and gabled roof with numerous dormers and especially in the combinations of large and small arched windows and the use of red-brick cladding combined with the rough-hewn, red sandstone blocks of the raised basement and the sandstone column of the front porch.&nbsp;
A high degree of artistic merit and craftsmanship is evident in the massing and complex roof-scape of the house with its gabled and hipped roof and variously-sized dormers, in the brick detailing of the window heads and belt courses, in the selection of a finer gauged brick with precise mortar joints for the principle north elevation and the combination with red sandstone and in the wood trim of the entablature, brackets and half-timbering.
The property at 685 Queen Street East has historic and associative value for its role within the growth and development of the Riverside community and its main street, Queen Street East as a local, community-oriented place, providing social services. The Dr. John B. Fraser office and residence property is valued for its association with the history of medical practice in Toronto and Riverside and medical practitioners, particularly Dr. Fraser and Dr. W. Ambrose Fish. Since 1976, Riverdale Co-operative Houses Inc. has been the owner and steward of the historic property exemplifying the community and social service uses that have occupied Queen Street East through the provision of affordable, rental housing. &nbsp;
The office-residence is valued as a representative of the work of the architect Charles F. Wagner, who was reputed to be one of Toronto's leading architects at the time the house was constructed, and who contributed other buildings on Riverside's Queen Street including the La Plaza Theatre (1909, altered 1932), at 733 Queen Street East, and also listed on the City's Heritage Register and the Dr. J. W. Rowan house (1909), 791 Queen Street East (demolished).&nbsp;
Contextually, the property has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the historic character of Riverside.&nbsp; Situated on the south side of Queen Street, just west of Broadview Avenue, it is an important contributor as it maintains the late 19th-early 20th century character with its two-three storey scale, combining commercial and residential use and period materials and details.&nbsp; Its set-back from the street with a small front garden and its house-form typology add to the variety and quality of the urban design and architectural character of the area.&nbsp;
Constructed in 1903-4, the property at 685 Queen Street East is visually and historically linked to its surroundings as a representative of a mixed residential-commercial use building, with form, massing and stylistic details which are characteristic of the early twentieth century. The property has been historically and functionally linked to community-oriented services of Riverside, first, as a medical office and since 1976 as co-operative, affordable, rental housing. As owners of 685 Queen Street East, the Riverdale Housing Co-operative Inc. has been, for almost 50 years, one of the affordable housing providers in the community who have also been stewards of an adaptively re-used a heritage building and will continue to serve the community in the future with its proposed building addition of more affordable rental housing units.&nbsp;

These two events were part of the historic transition of southern Scarborough from a 19th-century township characterized by large farm holdings clustered around small villages to a 20th-century municipality with planned suburbs stretched along the Lake Ontario shoreline and picturesque terrain of the Scarborough Bluffs.
Contextual Value
Set well back from Parkcrest Drive, the architecture and landscape of the F. J. Cornell house with its extensive lawns, mature trees and plantings, has contextual value as it contributes to the parklike setting of the Park Hill subdivision which features rustic winding streets with no sidewalks, a variety of mature deciduous and coniferous trees in an undulating terrain characteristic of the principles of the late 19th and early 20th-century Garden Suburb movement.

Reasons for Designation
The property located at 55 St. Edmunds Drive is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
Located at the northeast corner of St. Edmunds Drive and Lympstone Avenue, the property at 55 St. Edmunds Drive contains a two and a half storey residential house form building built in 1926 and designed in the Tudor Revival style by the architect William Breden Galbraith for Albert R. Greene. The stone and stucco clad building is part of the Lawrence Park neighbourhood, a 20th century subdivision developed as a Garden Suburb by the developer Wilfrid Servington Dinnick and which contains a significant collection of houses designed by leading early to mid-20th century architects in Toronto which ascribe to the principles of the Garden Suburb movement.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
55 St. Edmunds Drive is valued as a fine and representative example of a house designed in the Tudor Revival style, one of the handful of period revival styles that were popularized through the first half of the 20th century, especially within Garden Suburb neighbourhoods. Loosely based on early English building traditions, the style freely combined elements of Tudor, Medieval and Renaissance architecture, with significant variations informed by geography, context, period of construction and the builder. The house at 55 St. Edmunds Drive features architectural elements indicative of this popular period revival style; the primary fa&ccedil;ade fronting Lympstone Avenue is defined by two prominent sweeping gables, and is clad in stucco with stone detailing on the first floor and a tile roof. A wide variety of window openings - including bay, arched, flat headed and Palladian - add to the eclectic design and visual interest of the house's west and south facades, while fine detailing - including the brick corbels supporting brackets along the eaves lines, and the terra cotta finials &ndash; contribute to its design value. The house retains a high degree of integrity, maintaining original features and with minimal exterior alterations since its period of construction.
Historic and Associative Value
The house at 55 St. Edmunds Drive is reflective of the work of the architect William Breden Galbraith, a prolific and self-trained Toronto-based architect who was known for designing houses throughout the city's growing residential suburbs, including Lawrence Park, Forest Hill, Rosedale and Moore Park. Galbraith's architectural designs spanned a variety of Period Revival styles popular through the 1910s and 1920s, including Tudor Revival. Galbraith is known to have designed at least five other houses within Lawrence Park, a number of which featured the sloping rooflines and stone and stucco detailing seen at 55 St. Edmunds Drive and emblematic of the Tudor Revival style. The house at 55 St. Edmunds Drive was featured by Galbraith in his series of articles published in the Toronto weekly newspaper Saturday Night, and was later included in his 1930 publication A Canadian Home Plan Book (no. 1601).
The property at 55 St. Edmunds Drive is valued for its association with the Lawrence Park neighbourhood, a planned Garden Suburb originally marketed as the Lawrence Park Estates by the developer Wilfrid Servington Dinnick and laid out by the British engineer Walter S. Brooke with architectural plans by Chadwick &amp; Beckett and landscape design by Dunnington-Grubb. Built during the second major period of construction within the area - occurring between the end of the First World War and the Great Depression - 55 St. Edmunds Drive contributes to an understanding of the development and growth of the Lawrence Park neighbourhood, and reflects many of the features and aspects associated with the original plans for the area, and the principles of the Garden Suburb movement.
Contextually, the property at 55 St. Edmunds Drive is important in maintaining and supporting&nbsp;the character of the Lawrence Park neighbourhood as a designed Garden Suburb. The house is significantly setback from St. Edmunds Drive, with houses to the north gradually decreased in their setbacks in response to the curve of the street as it follows the contours of Lawrence Park. Designed in the Tudor Revival style - one of the Period Revival styles popular within the area - it contributes to an established and well recognized sense of place. Together with the house on the adjacent property located at the southeast corner of St. Edmunds Drive and Lympstone Avenue, the property at 55 St. Edmunds Drive serves as an important marker and informal gateway for those entering the neighbourhood from Yonge Street on Lympstone Avenue. The property at 55 St. Edmunds Drive is historically and visually linked to its surroundings, situated within the park-like setting of Lawrence Park defined by houses and gardens that fit harmoniously into the landscape.

J.C. Mussen Block
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 1354 (including active entrances 2, 4 and 6 Brock Avenue and 1356 Queen Street West), 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The properties at 1354 (including active entrances 2, 4 and 6 Brock Avenue and 1356 Queen Street West), 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are located at the northwest corner of Queen Street West and Brock Avenue. They are situated in the location of the historic Village of Parkdale (1878), which later became the Town of Parkdale in 1885 until it was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1889. The properties are located in the Parkdale Main Street.
1354 Queen Street West is comprised of a three-storey brick and stone, rectangular-form building at the northwest corner of Queen Street West and Brock Avenue. The property was constructed in c.1881 by J. C. Mussen as part of a business block that he erected west of the toll-gate at present-day Brock Avenue. The original occupant of this property was likely John Wanless &amp; Son, a hardware store. To the west of this property are 1358 and 1360 Queen Street West, which contain two, two-storey rectangular-form buildings and were also likely constructed as part of the J. C. Mussen Block in c.1881. It is not clear who the original occupants were of 1358 and 1360 Queen Street West.
The properties were included on the City's Heritage Register on December 16, 2020.
The properties are located in the Parkdale Main Street Heritage Conservation District study area.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The properties at 1354, 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are valued as representative examples of the Italianate style, which was popularized in Ontario during the mid-nineteenth century and was frequently applied to commercial buildings. The Italianate architectural style is characterized by the stylization and exaggeration of select features, often times with motifs being repeated several times across buildings. Elements of the style are evident at 1354 Queen Street West in the flat-headed window openings with stone sills at the second-storey of the principal (south) and side (east) elevations and in the semi-circular window openings with cast-stone sills in the third-storey of the same elevations. The style can further be seen in the segment of horizontal banding, which continues from the principal (south) elevation into the side (east) elevation and separates the second- and third-storey windows. The third-storey windows in the principal (south) elevation contain additional ornamentation, each surmounted by a semi-circular drip mould that is interrupted by a fluted corbel and sits atop a pilaster on either side. Also flanking each third-storey window is an extra level of detail in the form of punched foliage square panels. Above the third-storey windows in the principal (south) elevation is continuous dentil moulding, with an ornamental corbel at the termination of the side (west) elevation, and a cornice, which is set below continuous squared-off corbels. The dentil moulding and cornice are continued in the side (east) elevation, and the third-storey windows are set below a continuous horizontal banding that forms drip moulds above each window. In the rear (north) elevation below the roof are stepped corbels that connect to the dentil moulding.
The Italianate style can be seen in the properties at 1358 and 1360 Queen Street West in the masonry, which contains polychromatic red and yellow brick at the second-storey. At the second-storey is a continuous polychromatic brick banding in a soldier course pattern, which alternates between red and yellow brick and includes yellow brick laid horizontally on either side of the soldier course. Above the second-storey windows are yellow brick segmental-arches with red brick keystones above each window. Also evident of the Italianate style is the repetition of the segmental-arched windows, which appear in an alternating 1x2 pattern in the second-storey. Similar to the neighbouring property at 1360 Queen Street West, the windows contain stone sills, with the addition of two, stepped corbels at the base of each sill. These corbels mimic those that run along the roofline in red brick at 1360 Queen Street West. The corbels that appear below the cornice at 1358 Queen Street West are carved and smaller in scale.
Historical or Associative Value
The properties at 1354, 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are valued for their association with J. C. Mussen, a prominent businessman in Parkdale who was engaged in real estate and the insurance business. He was responsible for building several houses in Parkdale and he erected this business block, which became known as the J. C. Mussen Block, in the early-1880s.
The properties at 1354, 1356, and 1360 Queen Street West are valued for their association with Sheldon and Beverly Fainer, who owned and operated their fabric, trim, and hardware business, Designer Fabrics (originally Central Bargain House), at this location for 64-years. Two prominent members of the Parkdale community, the Fainers' business became a staple in Parkdale, and they even received recognition from Her Majesty the Queen, who presented Sheldon Fainer with a Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. The Fainers' consolidated the storefronts at 1358 and 1360 Queen Street West in 1968 to create a single entrance to the properties, and in c.2007, they expanded into the property at 1354 Queen Street West.
Contextual Value
The properties at 1354, 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are important in defining, maintaining, and supporting the character of the historic Village of Parkdale. The relationship of the properties to their setting is demonstrated by the placement, setback and orientation of the properties at the northwest corner of Queen Street West and Brock Avenue. In this location, the properties act as a gateway to that intersection in an area that was historically a working-class neighbourhood where merchants, professionals, company owners, and railway and factory workers lived and worked.
The properties at 1354, 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to their surroundings, where they anchor the northwest corner of Queen Street West and Brock Avenue. Despite 1354 Queen Street West being comprised of a different scale and massing than the neighbouring properties at 1358 and 1360 Queen Street West, they are nonetheless linked as they were simultaneously designed by J. C. Mussen. He designed all three properties in the same architectural style and in the same Main Street Commercial Block typology in order to complement one another. The properties at 1354, 1358, and 1360 Queen Street West are linked to the neighbouring properties on the north side of Queen Street West from O'Hara Avenue to Brock Avenue, where together, they establish the consistent main street character of predominantly Italianate-styled two- and three-storey buildings that are listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register. They are also linked to the heritage properties east of Brock Street on the north side of Queen Street West, and those on the south side of the street across from the subject properties between Dunn and Cowan Avenues

Beatty Manufacturing Co. Ltd.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 600 King Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
Description
The property at 600 King Street West is situated at the north-east corner of the intersection of King Street West and Portland Street. It contains a four-and-a-half-storey, brick-clad building constructed in 1901, to the designs of architects Chadwick &amp; Beckett, in the Edwardian Classical style for the Beatty Manufacturing Company Ltd.&nbsp;
The property was included on the City's Heritage Register in 1973 and is identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2017 and currently under appeal.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 600 King Street West has value as an exceptionally, finely-designed representative of the late-19th and early-20th-century-factory type, with its characteristic narrow, rectangular massing of the four-and-a-half-storey building (including a raised basement) with brick cladding, window openings arranged in a grid pattern expressive of the internal, post-and-beam structure and manufacturing function, and elements of Edwardian Classicism expressed in the tripartite organization of the principal (south) facade, the brick detailing, the arched openings, pilasters and columns.
A high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit is displayed in the design and construction of the brick details including rusticated striations, a variety of quoining, blocks encasing columns, as well as in the composition of the south and west facades with the variety of the paired and single-spaced windows and, on the south facade, the projecting central bay and variety of window heads. The combination of materials, brick, stone and wood and their varied surfaces contributes to the overall rich sense of texture in the street facades.
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 600 King Street West has value through its association with William Henry Beatty (1833-1912). W. H. Beatty was an astute and well-respected lawyer and businessman, creating one of the leading Canadian legal firms with his partner E.M. Chadwick, establishing numerous businesses including Beatty Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and the Confederation Life Association insurance company. Through his marriage to Charlotte Louisa Worts (1846-1928), Beatty earned the trust of the Gooderham family, served as a director of Gooderham and Worts, as well as President of the Bank of Toronto and as a president or director of numerous other companies.&nbsp;
The property has historical value through its potential to yield information about the development of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the late-19th and early-20th centuries as an important manufacturing centre which contributed to Toronto's growth and prosperity and, following the post-war departure of manufacturing, its rebirth as an important cultural and commercial centre for arts and entertainment. From its construction in 1901 until 1987, the property was used for manufacturing of goods related to fashion and upholstery. In 1987-8, its innovative adaptive re-use as a brewery/restaurant continued the zoned manufacturing use of the property while adding a commercial component reflective of the emerging renewal of the King-Spadina district.&nbsp;
The property has associative value as it demonstrates the work of the Toronto-based architects, Chadwick &amp; Beckett (1893-1917) who were a prolific partnership with numerous commissions which included a wide variety of buildings types. Along with the Beatty Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and the adjacent Canadian Kodak Co. Ltd building at 582 King Street West, the partners made a particular contribution to the design of industrial buildings across the City of Toronto in the first decade of the twentieth century.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Constructed in 1901 at the north-east corner of King Street West and Portland Street, the property at 600 King Street West, is important as it defines the late-19th and early-20th-century industrial character of the area, maintains the scale, material qualities and design patterns of the factory structures and features Edwardian Classical elements typical of the period.&nbsp;
For 120 years, the Beatty Manufacturing Co. Ltd. building has been physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings, first as a contributor
to 'Fashion District' identity of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, then, through its award-winning, adaptive re-use, it has played a significant role in revitalization of the neighbourhood as a vibrant commercial and cultural centre.&nbsp;

Reasons for Designation
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is located at the northeast corner of Bayview Avenue and Valleyanna Drive. It is located in the historic Township of York, which later became the Municipality of the Township of North York, on land that was originally surveyed as Concession II east of Yonge, Lot 4. In the 1930s, the first concession road east of Yonge Street was renamed Bayview Avenue.
2 Valleyanna Drive is comprised of a two-storey, L-shaped building. It is set behind a low, stone wall fronting Bayview Avenue, with a continuous row of Siberian elm trees that line the property to the north. The rectangular-shaped portion of the property fronting Bayview Avenue to the west was constructed from 1920-21 for Dr Herbert Alexander Bruce to serve as the visual and physical entryway to his 100-acre estate ""Annandale."" The gatehouse was designed by the prolific Toronto architect Eden Smith. In 1930, the property name was changed from ""Annandale"" to ""Uplands"" by Alfred Rogers and his wife, Winifrede M. Rogers, who owned the property.
In 1956-7, after the Annandale estate house was demolished, the gatehouse property, then called ""Uplands,"" was sold to Frederick E. Fletcher and his wife, Barbara Jean Fletcher. The gatehouse was converted for residential use and was given the address of 2 Valleyanna Drive after Valleyanna Drive was created. The adaptive reuse involved conceptually re-orienting the converted gatehouse to the quieter residential street of Valleyanna Drive by filling in the original carriageway and introducing the front entrance on the east elevation. It also involved conducting interior alterations and adding the octagonal dining room wing at the northeast end of the property, which created its present L-shape plan.
2 Valleyanna Drive was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on September 27, 2006.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is valued as representative example of a gatehouse building type that is fashioned in the Arts and Crafts and Tudor Revival styles. Gatehouses were commonly erected on the site of twentieth century country estates at the edge of the property to serve as the visual and functional entryway to the grounds. Representative of this building typology in the west elevation are the archway below the jerkinhead roof, which originally served as the carriageway, the flanking flat-headed windows and those below the roof dormer, which were meant to provide interior lighting, and the ornamental gateposts with spherical finials connecting to low, stone walls that surround the property on Bayview Avenue. Also indicative of the property's typology in the east elevation are the flat-headed windows with stone lintels and sills and the original two, garage bay openings in the first-storey that presently contain sliding glass doors.
At 2 Valleyanna Drive, the Arts and Crafts style is evident in the restrained decoration at the west elevation and the asymmetrical design, which illustrates the guiding principle of the style pertaining to function-over-ornamentation. The style can also be seen in the uniform stone masonry, the low terracotta roof, where the only ornamentation is the flat-headed dormer window, the jerkinhead roof over the original carriageway and the general varying roofline, and the prominent chimney.
In the east elevation, which would have originally faced the interior grounds of the Annandale estate, additional ornamentation is applied in the Tudor Revival style. This includes the turret at the southeast corner, which is ornamented with a strip of horizontal stone banding, the second-storey projecting window above the central entryway and below the roof gable, the ornamental half-timbering, and the materials, including stone, stucco, and wood.
Historical or Associative Value
The property at 2 Valleyanna is valued for its association with its original owner,
Dr Herbert Alexander Bruce, a well-known figure in Canadian elite circles. Bruce founded the Wellesley Hospital in Toronto, was the Inspector-General of the Canadian Medical Services during WWI, was the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1932-37, and served as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Toronto from 1940-46. Bruce was known as being a champion of cancer care in the 1920s, social housing in the 1930s, better health care for the military and veterans, and the introduction of contributory health insurance in the 1940s.
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is valued for its association with Alfred Rogers, heir to the Elias Rogers Coal Company, which was known for having some of the largest and most improved coal handling facilities in all of Canada during the late-nineteenth century.[1] He and his wife owned 2 Valleyanna Drive from 1930 and changed its name from ""Annandale"" to ""Uplands,"" which is reflected on the nameplate in the west elevation.
The subject property has value for its potential to yield information about the presence of the historic 100-acre Annandale estate, which was once located to the east of the gatehouse prior to the creation of Valleyanna Drive in 1956-57. The grounds of this estate characterized the east side of Bayview Avenue, south of Lawrence, across from Dawlish Avenue for several decades, with 2 Valleyanna continuing to reference this original connection.
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is valued for its association with the prolific Toronto architect, Eden Smith. With a portfolio amounting to several hundred residential, institutional, ecclesiastical, and commercial commissions, Smith was particularly active in Toronto from the late-nineteenth century and into the first two decades of the twentieth century. Known particularly for his innumerable residential projects in the Arts and Crafts style, Smith was engaged by Bruce to design his country estate at Annandale, which included the original estate house (demolished in 1956-57) and gatehouse at 2 Valleyanna Drive. With his career winding down by the early-1920s, his designs for the Annandale properties appear to be amongst his last projects prior to retiring.
Contextual Value
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is important in defining, maintaining, and supporting the historic character of the 100-acre tract of land originally known as Concession II, Lot 4 in the Township of York. In the 1920s, it contained a private road leading from Bayview Avenue to the private estate grounds at Annandale, with the gatehouse serving as the visual and functional entryway on Bayview Avenue. The relationship of the property to its setting is demonstrated by its placement, setback and orientation on the east side of Bayview Avenue where the private road was originally located, where it now holds a prominent position at the entrance of Valleyanna Drive.
The property at 2 Valleyanna Drive is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings, where it anchors the northeast corner of Bayview Avenue and Valleyanna Drive. With its two-storey scale, massing, and the rectangular-form of the original gatehouse that was oriented to respond to the north-south positioning of Bayview Avenue, the property continues to convey its historic link to the tract of land originally known as the Annandale estate.

The octagonal dining room wing in the east elevation was a 1950s addition and was not designed by Eden Smith. It is not being identified as a heritage attribute in this report.

Edward G. Woodley House&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 183 Avenue Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located on the east side of Avenue Road between Pears Avenue and Davenport Road, the property at 183 Avenue Road contains a detached, red brick house-form building (currently painted) constructed by 1901 and first occupied by Edward G. Woodley, a well-known local builder. Alterations to the openings at the first-floor level reflect the addition of commercial/retail use to the original house-form building by the mid-20th century. The property was included on the City's Heritage Register on February 6, 1974.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property at 183 Avenue Road has design value as a representative example of a transitional, Late-Victorian/Edwardian era dwelling with its centred roof gable surmounting a centred third-storey window opening and expressed with minimal decorative detailing.
Historical and Associative Value
The Edward G. Woodley House stands as a defining property within a group of four adjacent heritage house-form buildings on this block of Avenue Road, just north of Davenport Road, and constructed by the Woodley family between 1898 and 1901. Of the four dwellings, the Woodley families built the four surviving house-form buildings at 177-183 Avenue Road, owned and occupied 183 Avenue Road for over half a century and are remembered as active members of the Deer Park community.
Contextual Value
Representing the earliest period in the subdivision of Town Lot 22, the house form of the Edward G. Woodley House is physically, visually and historically linked to its setting as part of the collection of four surviving heritage properties at 177-183 Avenue Road built together at the turn of the 20th century by the Woodleys. The property is also considered an important component in the history and evolution of Avenue Road as a residential street prior to its widening and redevelopment in the mid-20th century.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 355-359 Adelaide Street West, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 355-359 Adelaide Street West is located on the south side of Adelaide Street, east of the intersection with Spadina Avenue.&nbsp; It contains a six-and-a-half storey, brick-clad factory building, designed in the Renaissance Revival style by the architect Benjamin Brown and constructed in 1921-2 for Moses and Louis Gelber.
&nbsp;
The property was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2017 and is identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2017 and currently under appeal.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1921-2, the building at 355-359 Adelaide Street West has design and physical value as a well-designed and carefully-detailed example of an early, 20th-century factory building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; The low-rise, six-storey building has a raised basement, brick cladding and regularly-spaced windows expressive of the internal post and beam factory function which are characteristic features of the type.&nbsp; The design of the principal (north) elevation which is arranged with a base, mid-section and top is also characteristic of the early 20th-century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The building at 355-359 Adelaide Street West is representative of the adaptation of the Classical Renaissance style of an Italian palazzo to a factory building.&nbsp; This is seen in the organization of the principal (north) elevation with a rusticated base, a mid-section with pilasters rising four storeys and terminating in stone capitals and with the top or attic storey indicated with the stone belt course and the raised panels at the roofline.&nbsp; The building exhibits further Italian Renaissance Classicism in its use of bilateral symmetry seen in the emphasis on the two outer bays, which are narrower with narrower windows, step slightly forward, feature arches with keystones at the fifth storey and raised segmentally-arched panels of the parapet.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property has historical value for its association with the Gelber family.&nbsp; Moses and Louis Gelber immigrated to Canada in the 1890s and their entrepreneurship resulted in the creation of several Toronto-based businesses, including the Imperial Manufacturing Company, Gelber Brothers Ltd. and Gelber Realty Ltd. and the construction of many fine warehouse and factory buildings which continue to contribute to the character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood. The Gelber Brothers were philanthropists and leaders in Toronto's Jewish community, establishing numerous charities including the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, as well as the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Toronto Zionist Council, the Toronto Hebrew Free School and the Primrose Club.&nbsp; Their exemplary leadership was extended by their children Edward, Marvin, Arthur, Sylva and Lionel who contributed to philanthropic causes as well as being leaders in Canadian politics and the United Nations, Jewish political and cultural organizations, the AGO, the National Ballet, the Monk School of International Affairs and through the federal Department of Labour initiated support for Canadian women's rights to equal pay and benefits.&nbsp; The legacy of their contributions is continued through the Lionel Gelber Prize at the Monk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, the Sylva Gelber Music Foundation, and the Marvin Gelber Print and Drawing Study Centre and the Marvin Gelber Gallery at the Art Gallery of Ontario.
&nbsp;
The factory building at 355-359 Adelaide Street West has the potential to yield information that contributes to an understanding of the history and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as a manufacturing centre particularly as it relates to its identity as the Fashion District.&nbsp; Constructed by the Gelber Brothers as an ancillary building to their business, from the time of its completion in 1922 until 1987, the building was home to a variety of small businesses associated with the production of clothing. Following the decentring of manufacturing from the downtown core, the building was part of the renaissance of the neighbourhood as it was occupied by Grey Advertising who were permitted to change the building from manufacturing to office use.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The factory building reflects the early career of Benjamin Brown (1890-1974), who graduated from the University of Toronto in 1913 and was one of Toronto's earliest Jewish architects.&nbsp; Brown's buildings in the early 1920s contributed significantly to a representation of Jewish community life in Toronto as he designed the Beth Jacob Synagogue on Henry Street, the Hebrew Free School on Brunswick Avenue, the Primrose Club on Willcocks Street and numerous factory buildings for the Gelber Brothers and others including the Spadina Avenue landmarks, the Tower Building and Balfour Building and the Commodore Building, 325 Adelaide Street West. Brown also designed several apartment buildings and private residences as well as the 1937 Paradise Theatre on Bloor Street West. The buildings identified above have all been listed on the City's Heritage Register and two have been designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act.
&nbsp;
Located on the south side of Adelaide Street West, just east of Spadina Avenue, the property at 355-359 Spadina Avenue is important as it maintains and supports the character of the King-Spadina district as an early, 20th-century manufacturing hub in the City of Toronto, maintaining the low to mid-rise scale, and contributing to the material qualities of brick-clad factory buildings with their principal facades detailed in a rich variety of architectural styles.
&nbsp;
Completed in 1922, for the first 65 years of its life, the building served as home to various businesses associated with clothing manufacture and the Fashion District identity of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Its distinctive early 20th-century factory plan has enabled its adaptive re-use throughout its history, including its conversion to office space as part of the renaissance of the King-Spadina district initiated in the late 1960s.&nbsp; The building is functionally, historically and visually linked to its surroundings.

&nbsp;
Description
The property at 537 Broadview Avenue is located at the south-east corner of Broadview Avenue and Sparkhall Avenue, opposite Riverdale Park in the Riverdale North neighbourhood.&nbsp; Constructed for Rev. Dr. John McPherson Scott and his wife Margaret G. Scott, in 1913, the house is a two-and-a-half storey, brick-clad, house-form building designed as a well-crafted blend of the Queen Anne Revival and Edwardian Classical styles.&nbsp; In 1956, the building was converted to a lodging house, and later a nursing home, and currently contains six dwelling units.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2009.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1913, the Scott house has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th-century house-form building that blends Edwardian Classicism and the Queen Anne Revival styles.&nbsp; The Edwardian Classical elements are evident in the symmetrical, gable-roofed form of the square-plan building with its central hall plan, the paired chimneys, columned, two-storey verandah, the details of the eaves and the deep-red colour of the brick.&nbsp; The Queen Anne Revival style, noted for its asymmetry and visual complexity of forms and materials is represented on the principal, west, elevation in the asymmetrical location of the corner bay window, the shingle cladding of the north, bay window, the asymmetrical position of the verandah and the oriel windows featured on the north fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property has historical value for its association with Rev. Dr. John McPherson Scott, who with his wife, Margaret G. Scott, were the original owners and occupants of the house. Rev. Dr. Scott is a person of significance to the Presbyterian community as he was a missionary and a pastor for 31 years at the congregation of St. John's Presbyterian Church, Riverdale, and oversaw the construction of the church building completed in 1907 and still extent at 415 Broadview Avenue.&nbsp; As part of his missionary work, Rev. Dr. Scott established the controversial Presbyterian Mission to the Jews in the Ward in 1908. Upon Scott's death in 1920, the mission evolved to become the Scott Institute with a broader community outreach program and subsequently the Scott Mission, commemorating Rev. Dr. Scott in its name.&nbsp; The Scott Mission continues to function as a Christian, non-denominational, urban mission which has provided significant community outreach services for over 80 years.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Description
Located on the north side of Lytton Boulevard between Yonge Street and Duplex Avenue, the property at 22 Lytton Boulevard (The Goodwin House) is valued as a unique and representative example of the Tudor Revival style with Craftsman elements within the Lytton Park neighbourhood. The property was part of an early subdivision within the area, called Alexandra Gardens, and was one of the first houses to be constructed following the registration of the plan for subdivision in 1910. Alexandra Gardens was registered and sold by the financier Edward Bentley Stockdale through the Trusts and Guarantees Company, for which he served as General Manager. Alexandra Gardens was a popular and highly-desirable subdivision comprising Lytton, Alexandra and Strathallan Boulevards, and was primarily developed between 1910 and the onset of World War II. Within Alexandra Gardens and Lytton Park, 22 Lytton Boulevard stands out as a unique and early Tudor Revival style house, with a form, massing and detailing that is distinct within the neighbourhood.
&nbsp;
Design and Physical Value
Designed in the Tudor Revival style, the house at 22 Lytton Boulevard retains architectural elements indicative of this popular period revival style. The principal (south) fa&ccedil;ade of 22 Lytton Boulevard is slightly asymmetrical, comprised of two gabled bays, one larger than the other, flanking a central entrance covered by a gabled portico. The two gables both feature applied false half-timbering and wide bargeboards, with exposed rafters extending from the primary gabled roof protruding below. The house retains a high degree of integrity, maintaining original features and with minimal exterior alterations since its period of construction.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 22 Lytton Boulevard is associated with the photographer and amateur ornithologist Janet Goodwin, who lived at the house from c.1948 to c.1973. Born in Toronto in 1900 and raised in The Annex neighbourhood, Janet married John Goodwin, and the couple acquired the house from John's father, Edward, in 1948. Janet Goodwin was a celebrated nature photographer in Toronto and internationally, receiving critical acclaim and awards for her work. She was a founding member, in 1947, of the Toronto Guild for Colour Photography, and ran the Guild's popular ""Nature"" workshops out of her house at 22 Lytton Boulevard. In 1952 she was a founding member of the Margaret Nice Ornithological Club, established in protest to the gender-based exclusionary policies of the Toronto Ornithological Club, and which provided women ornithologists a place to explore and make significant contributions to the field and wildlife conservation. Janet sold the house in 1973, following the passing of her husband John, concluding 50 years of the Goodwin family's ownership of the property.

The South Humber Park Pavilion
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 85 Stephen Drive (including entrance addresses at 75 High Street and 120 The Queensway) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 85 Stephen Drive (including entrance addresses at 75 High Street and 120 The Queensway) is located within the South Humber Park, north of the Humber River Recreational Trail. It is bordered by the Humber River to the east, Stonegate Road to the north, Stephen Drive to the west, and The Queensway and the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant to the south. Known as the South Humber Park Pavilion or ""the Oculus,"" the purpose-built structure was designed in 1958-9 for visitors to the new South Humber Park and set within the park's expansive picturesque landscape. The park was created in tandem with the adjacent Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant development and part of the citywide flood control of ravines and valleylands after Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The pavilion was designed by the architect Alan Crossley in collaboration with the engineer Laurence George Cazaly. The South Humber Park Pavilion contains three separate but conceptually linked elements which form a singular structure: a trapezoidal ground plane of flagstone pavers, a concrete shelter structure with an oculus to allow sunlight to penetrate, and a rounded washroom building that is faced in stone of varied sizes. The South Humber Park Pavilion is a local landmark, and running south of the structure is the Humber River Recreational Trail, which was installed in the 1980s and increased access to the pavilion. There was also a cairn stone drinking fountain to the side (west) of the structure, which has been removed.
&nbsp;
In the years after the South Humber Park Pavilion was completed, it fell into disrepair and has recently undergone restoration in 2021.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 85 Stephen Drive is valued as a rare and unique example of the Googie architectural style, which was popularized in the U.S. post-WWII, especially through the sunbelt regions of Southern California, Arizona, and Florida. An ultramodern or futuristic architectural style that was inspired by car culture and the Space Age, the Googie style was characterized by upswept roof designs, flying saucer shapes, rounded angles, and exaggerated geometric forms. While the style made its way to Canada during the 1960s and 70s, there are few surviving examples of properties that were designed in the style. Elements of the style are evident at the South Humber Park Pavilion in the scale, form, and massing, which include exaggerated geometric forms that create an asymmetrical pavilion consisting of a trapezoidal ground plane of flagstone pavers, a concrete shelter structure, and a rounded washroom building that is faced in stone of varied sizes. The style can further be seen in the flying saucer-like shelter structure, which includes a concrete canopy that is circular in shape, with its section consisting of an inverted and tilted concrete bowl that dips up towards an off-centre opening or ""oculus"" that casts light on the flagstone below that moves based on the time of day. The concrete canopy of the shelter structure, which was poured-in-place, is supported by seven steel columns encircling the canopy and sits above the roof of the washroom building.
&nbsp;
With the skillful and imaginative arrangement of the stone and concrete elements of the South Humber Park Pavilion set into the picturesque landscape of the park within which it is imbedded, the property at 85 Stephen Drive displays a high degree of craftsmanship or artistic merit.
&nbsp;
The property at 85 Stephen Drive demonstrates a high degree of technical or scientific achievement. This is demonstrated in the shelter structure, the concrete canopy of which was poured-in-place, and was designed by Laurence Cazaly who was a pioneer in concrete construction engineering in Toronto.
&nbsp;
Historical or Associative Value
The South Humber Park Pavilion at 85 Stephen Drive is valued for its association with the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, which had been newly-established in 1953 and who owned the parkland, and the Metropolitan Parks Department, who constructed the pavilion and maintained the parkland. The South Humber Park Pavilion was constructed within the first decade of regional infrastructure works undertaken by Metro Toronto, and it remains a distinctive structure constructed by Metro Parks in the 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 85 Stephen Drive is valued for its association with the British-born architect Alan Crossley, who immigrated to Ontario in 1948 and opened a private architectural and town planning practice in Toronto with his wife, Constance Burns Crossley in 1956. Although the extent of his architectural portfolio is not clear, the South Humber Park Pavilion is Crossley's best known work and the property is significant to the larger community that continues to engage with the pavilion while visiting South Humber Park.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 85 Stephen Drive has additional value for its association with Laurence George Cazaly, who was the engineer responsible for designing the shelter structure at the South Humber Park Pavilion. A pivotal figure involved in the advancements of concrete construction engineering in Post-War Toronto, Cazaly designed numerous prestressed bridges and concrete warehouses in and outside of the city. In 1959, he was presented the Martin P. Kom Award in by the Prestressed Concrete institute in New York City and went on to publish the Canadian Prestressed Concrete Institute Handbook (1964) alongside Mark K. Huggins. Only recently retiring, Cazaly amassed an extensive portfolio and maintained a successful practice for many decades.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Developed as a purpose-built pavilion within the new South Humber Park during the late-1950s north of the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant, the South Humber Park Pavilion is physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to its surroundings. The relationship of the property to its setting is demonstrated by the placement, setback, and orientation of the pavilion, which is set into the expansive landscape of the South Humber Park to the north of the plant and north of the Humber River Recreational Trail, which was installed in the 1980s.
&nbsp;
Holding a prominent place within its context in South Humber Park since the time of its construction in 1958-9, the property at 85 Stephen Drive is a local landmark that is meaningful to the community. Although dense underbrush has partially closed-in the rear (north) elevation and the side (eastern and western) wings, the installation of the Humber River Recreational Trail during the 1980s enhanced accessibility to the structure. As a result, new animation and an increase in legibility was afforded to the South Humber Park Pavilion making it easily discernable to park visitors travelling east or west towards it on the trail. As a result of significant community interest and effort, The Oculus Revitalization project is presently underway and will see the rehabilitation of the landmark structure. The South Humber Park Pavilion continues to serve as an orientation guide within South Humber Park today.

109 George Street
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 109 George Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the east side of George Street south of Richmond Street East, the property at 109 George Street contains a complex of three interconnected industrial/office structures built between 1915 and 1950. The property was identified for its cultural heritage value through the King-Parliament Secondary Plan Review (2019) and listed on the City's Heritage Register in December 2020.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 109 George Street (with entrance address at 117) has cultural heritage value as a representative early 20th-century example of the warehouse / factory typology, which is evident in the design of the two-three storey, mixed-use industrial and office complex where the original red brick warehouse structure (1915) is setback on the lot and attached to the rear of the 1926 building fronting onto George Street and containing the original primary entrance at the south end of the west elevation. Typical of late-19th and early-20th century warehouse / factory type buildings identified in the King-Parliament area, Classical detailing here includes brick cladding, the principal (west) street-facing elevation embellished with stone trim and classical-style surround on the primary entrance, first-floor stone cornice, and diamond and lozenge detailing at the second and third storeys.
&nbsp;
The property is also valued for its association with Frankel Brothers Ltd, a successful scrap metal processing company established owned by German-Jewish philanthropist and entrepreneur Leo Frankel along with his brothers, Maurice and Sigmund. Initially used as a storage yard for the company, the family commissioned the 1915 rear portion of the current complex plus the 1926 portion fronting onto George Street, both of which the successful company rented out to various industrial and commercial tenants over the course of their 45-year ownership at the site.
&nbsp;
The property at 109 George Street has historic and associative value for its role within the growth and land development of the old Town of York plan. The ten original city blocks are currently understood as part of the King-Parliament area, which includes some of Toronto&rsquo;s oldest neighbourhoods and commercial and industrial areas.
&nbsp;
The complex is valued for its association with the prominent local architectural firm of Chapman &amp; Oxley, who constructed the three-storey red brick structure fronting George Street in 1926. Aside from numerous other industrial commissions completed in the downtown core at the time, the Chapman &amp; Oxley firm is also distinguished for its defining architectural contributions to the Canadian National Exhibition including the Pure Food Building (1921-22), the Ontario Government Building (1926), The Prince's Gate (1927) and the Electrical and Engineering Building (1928-1929). Since 2011, the property is also valued for its association with current tenant, Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects, a Toronto-based Canadian architecture firm established in 1970 with a world-wise reputation for excellence in design and responsible for minor enhancements to the openings on the primary (west) elevation at George Street including the horizontal brise-soleil at the ground-storey.
&nbsp;
Contextually, the property has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the historic character of the King-Parliament area. Situated on the east side of George Street south of Richmond Street East, it is an important contributor as it maintains the early 20th century character with its two-three storey scale, industrial use and period details. Its substantial footprint and warehouse / factory typology typify the late-19th to early-20th century built form evolution and character of the area.
&nbsp;
Constructed in three stages (1915 with 1926 and 1950 additions), the property at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 109-117 George Street is visually and historically linked to its surroundings as a representative example of an industrial warehouse building, with form, massing and stylistic details characteristic of the early twentieth century. The property is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to the historic, industrial character of the King-Parliament area along with other surviving low-scale, warehouse / factory type buildings of the period that weren&rsquo;t subsequently lost to industrial decline and urban renewal in the second half of the 20th century.&nbsp;

Description
Located at the southeast corner of George Street and Richmond Street East, the property at 125 George Street contains a four-storey industrial building identified for its cultural heritage value through the King-Parliament Secondary Plan Review (2019) and listed on the City's Heritage Register in December 2020.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property located at 125 George Street has cultural heritage value as an early 20th-century example of the warehouse / factory typology, which is evident in the design of the four-storey industrial building with two principal elevations abutting the southeast corner of George and Richmond streets, where the main entrance is located on the George Street (west) elevation, and the loading bay with its original steel awning is located on the north elevation fronting onto Richmond Street East. Built in 1927, this post-and-beam industrial building is a rare surviving, early example in the city that is constructed with an exposed, pre-cast concrete frame set on a raised foundation and containing brick infill. The grid-like form of the frame produces a relentless repetition and dimensional uniformity of red brick infill spandrels across all four elevations, and containing window openings with original steel arrowhead mullions and frames. Typical of late-19th and early-20th century warehouse / factory type buildings, lingering Classical detailing is evident in the elegant main entrance at the south end of the west elevation, with its pre-cast Georgian-style surround including decorative scroll brackets supporting a projecting header and all surmounted by a fan-shaped transom light.&nbsp;

Reasons for Designation
The property at 1140 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
Located at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and Marlborough Avenue, the property at 1140 Yonge Street contains a one-storey commercial main street building originally constructed in 1930 as an early-20th century automobile showroom and adaptively re-used as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Studio D/4 and recognized on the City's Heritage Register since September 25, 1978. The window openings of the showroom were filled in by the CBC in the mid-1950s to serve their filming studio needs. A series of modifications over the course of the 20th century have also removed some of the original decorative architectural details; however, documentary evidence would enable their restoration in future.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property located at 1140 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value as a fine, unique example of the early-20th century automobile showroom/dealership typology, which is evident in the design of the one-storey building with its double-height cast stone arches and columns containing round-arched windows (many currently filled in) along the east (Yonge Street) and partial north (Marlborough Avenue) elevations. The building displays a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit through its use of cast stone sculptures by artist Merle Foster. These design elements feature a high degree of exuberant detailing, intended to convey a sense of opulence, and incorporate a range of decorative architectural details from various stylistic influences including the Byzantine and Renaissance Revival architectural style.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 1140 Yonge Street is valued for its association with the Pierce-Arrow company, which manufactured luxury automobiles during the early-20th century, before declaring bankruptcy in 1938 due to the economic impacts of the Great Depression.
&nbsp;
The building demonstrates the work of the architectural firm Sparling, Martin &amp; Forbes. While architect William F. Sparling's partnership with Martin and Forbes only lasted from 1928 to 1931, Sparling was known for a number of buildings under his own name, including the Metropolitan Building at Adelaide Street East and Victoria Street and the Masonic Temple at Yonge Street and Davenport Road. Sparling&rsquo;s work often incorporated exuberant Byzantine and Renaissance Revival stylistic elements that are echoed in the design at 1140 Yonge Street, including patterned veneer brick, decorative arches and sculptural pieces.
&nbsp;
The property is also valued for its association with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), who purchased the building in 1953 and converted the interior space into the company's primary filming production studio in the city until relocating to the CBC's current headquarters (also known as the Canadian Broadcasting Centre) at 250 Front Street in the early 1990s. Known as Studio D/4, the studio represents the national broadcaster&rsquo;s foray into television, with shows such as Flashback, Front Page Challenge, Mr. Dressup, Juliette, and the Tommy Hunter Show filmed on the property.
&nbsp;
The property also has a direct association with artist Merle Foster, a renowned and respected Toronto sculptor, who designed the cast-stone sculptural detailing on the principal (east and north) elevations. In keeping with her oeuvre, the cast-stone detailing at 1140 Yonge Street features medieval-inspired sculptures such as gargoyles, as well as more Classically-informed figures such as the man holding the car and tire. The sculptural work of Merle Foster provides a greater understanding of women in the art and sculpture community in early-20th century Toronto.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the historic character of this portion of Yonge Street.&nbsp; Situated at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and Marlborough Avenue, it is an important contributor as it maintains the late-19th to early-20th century main street commercial built form evolution and historic character of the area, along with the adjacent heritage buildings at 1148 Yonge Street and 1095-1099 Yonge Street.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1930, the commercial main street property at 1140 Yonge Street is visually, physically and historically linked to its surroundings as a fine, rare example of an automobile showroom building with form, massing and stylistic details characteristic of the early-20th century and typically located along the city's main commercial thoroughfares such as Yonge Street, Bay Street and Danforth Avenue.

&nbsp;
increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers; increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees; &nbsp;
As shown in Appendix A (http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-172792.pdf), the recommended increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective January 1, 2022, are as follows:
&nbsp;
for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate &nbsp;and the Block 2 Rate by 3%; andfor flat rate consumers, all rates by 3%.&nbsp;
The proposed increases to water and wastewater service fees, effective January 1, 2022, are shown in Appendix B (http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2021/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-172793.pdf).
&nbsp;
City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.
&nbsp;
The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, are set out in the report to the Budget Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and the General Manager, Toronto Water entitled ""2022 Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees "" (the ""Report"").
&nbsp;
The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2022 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.447 billion, which is fully funded from the 2022 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services.
&nbsp;
The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services.

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO DESIGNATE THE PROPERTY
TAKE NOTICE that Council for the City of Toronto intends to designate the property, including the lands, buildings and structures thereon known municipally as 164 Bathurst Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.O.18, as amended, as a property of cultural heritage value or interest.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 164 Bathurst Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value and contextual value.
Description
The property at 164 Bathurst Street, dating to c.1875, is a mixed-use building with commercial use at the ground floor and residential use above. Having served various commercial occupants since its construction, including a hotel, grocery stores, and ""box lunch"" shops, it currently houses a restaurant. Oriented towards Bathurst Street, the building's primary component is a two-and-a-half storey structure, with a two-storey rear portion along Richmond Street West.&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Dating to c.1875, the property at 164 Bathurst Street is a representative example of a mixed-use commercial building from the late nineteenth century. It retains its scale, form, and massing as a two/two-and-a-half-storey brick building with a cross-gable roof, original openings at the upper storey, and details that suggest the influence of the Italianate style, which was popular in Ontario between the 1850s and 1880s. This style typically featured a prominent application of Classical vocabulary, as seen in this property's brick quoins and pronounced wood brackets beneath the eaves. Apart from various alterations at the ground storey, the building's most substantial modification appears to have been a small rear extension in the 1880s to expand the property's commercial capacity.
Sited at the corner of Bathurst Street and Richmond Street West, the property is important in maintaining and supporting the character of the surrounding area. The building's location at the intersection of two thoroughfares heightens its position as a historic anchor within an evolved block. The property is also visually and historically linked to its surroundings as one of the oldest mixed-use commercial properties in the immediate area. As the earliest mixed-use commercial building along this portion of Bathurst Street, which was otherwise substantially developed by 1889, the property is a significant remnant of the nineteenth-century streetscape to which it long contributed.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 250 University Avenue is worth of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative and contextual values
Description
Located on the southwest corner of University Avenue and Queen Street West, the property at 250 University Avenue known as the Bank of Canada Building contains an eight storey plus penthouse office building constructed between 1955 and 1958, designed in the Neo-Georgian architectural style by the architectural firm of Marani &amp; Morris. Built as the Toronto Agency offices for the Bank of Canada and housing additional space for lease, the granite-clad building with fine detailing is situated prominently on University Avenue and contributes to the ceremonial boulevard's present-day character and formal landscape.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The Bank of Canada Building at 250 University Avenue has design and physical value as an excellent representative example of a mid-20th century office building, designed in the Neo-Georgian architectural style. The scale, form and massing of the building is emblematic of this building type, occupying a full city block and commanding a strong presence on the southwest corner of University Avenue and Queen Street West. The building's Neo-Georgian architectural style is evident in the tripartite arrangement of the primary (east) fa&ccedil;ade, the two side facades, and the restrained yet high-quality materiality of the building's cladding. The building's design and physical value is also related to its high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit, exhibited through the purposeful integration of art both on the exterior and within the interior lobby, with works commissioned from and executed by leading 20th century artists including Cleeve Horne, Louis Temporale, Alexander Scott Carter, Stanley Arculus and Alan Caswell Collier. The building is also reflective of the design intent of the University Avenue by-law, which sought to establish a consistent streetscape and a high level of architectural design along this ceremonial route.
Historical and Associative Value
The historical and associative value of the Bank of Canada Building is apparent through its direct associations with the Bank of Canada is a significant institution within the history of the Canada and which has contributed significantly to the growth and development of Canada's economy through the 20th century. The building retains features that reflect its association with the Bank of Canada, including the federal coat of arms above the primary entrance, and is a significant property that speaks to the presence of the institution within Toronto.
The Bank of Canada Building is reflective of the work of the architectural firm Marani &amp; Morris, one of Toronto's leading 20th century modern architectural practices. Comprised of a partnership between Ferdinand Herbert Marani and Robert Schofield Morris, the firm was a leading proponent of conservative modernism in the mid-20th century, responsible for numerous high quality projects for institutional and corporate clients. The Bank of Canada Building is emblematic of the firm's high quality work, with a decidedly modern massing and form that remains steeped in the principles of classicism and an honesty of materials. The opening of the Bank of Canada Building coincided with Robert Morris receiving the Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1958, and shortly before the promotion of Marvin Francis Allan to partner in 1959. The firm continues to practice today as RDHA.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the Bank of Canada Building at 250 University Avenue maintains and supports the character of the University Avenue Precinct, one of Toronto's major streets and a significant ceremonial avenue that is home to a collection of significant buildings associated with important institutions in Toronto's history and constructed during the 20th century. The Bank of Canada Building is historically and visually linked with its surroundings, including the Confederation Life Building which was designed in accordance with the University Avenue by-law, and the Superior Court of Justice (formerly the Metropolitan Toronto Courthouse) , which was a commission of Marani, Morris and Allan. It is also linked to the modernist design of University Avenue, which was completed between 1960 and 1962 to the designs of Dunnington-Grubb &amp; Stensson. The building also contributes to the landmark intersection of University Avenue and Queen Street West, and is one of the four significant buildings at that intersection which reflect the history and evolution of the area from the Town of York through to the present-day.

NOTICE OF INTENTION TO DESIGNATE THE PROPERTY
TAKE NOTICE that Council for the City of Toronto intends to designate the property, including the lands, buildings and structures thereon known municipally as 1007 Craven Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.O.18, as amended, as a property of cultural heritage value or interest.
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 1007 Craven Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
Description
The property at 1007 Craven Road is located on the east side of Craven Road, south of Danforth Avenue, north of Hanson Street, west of Coxwell Avenue, and east of Parkmount Road. It contains the Craven Road House (1993-96), a two-storey, wood and cement-board clad building and the Craven Road Studio (2004-6) a single-storey, wood-clad building which was designed as a garage as per municipal approvals. The house and studio are owned by Robert G. Hill, who commissioned Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe of Shim-Sutcliffe Architects Inc. to realize the project. The green roof was added to the studio in 2007. The House received a Governor General's Award in 1997 and the Studio received a Governor General's Medal in 2010.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The Craven Road House and Studio and their landscaped setting are representative of the Critical Regionalism style in their ""highly contextual approach to the creation of architecture"" and in their ""penchant for typological invention.""[1] The Craven Road House reinvents a live-work space for a single person as a blend of the Victorian cottage and the industrial loft types creating a unique, and award-winning, world-renowned complex for its occupant.&nbsp; Similarly the Craven Road Studio adapts the garage-ancillary outbuilding type as a private gallery and studio. Through a series of strategies which are rooted in the principles of the context and with a reinvention of its associated building typologies a new urban living condition which maximizes landscaped open-space is created. In its location on an unusual City of Toronto road which is partially a laneway in its origins and character and in the redevelopment of formerly vacant and underused lots, the house and studio represent a precedent for urban infill and densification creating an uncharacteristic landscaped setting.
The Craven Road House displays a high degree of artistic merit in its architectural planning with the creation of intimate living spaces which are distinct from the grand and airy work spaces providing a desirable place for its inhabitant to live and work.&nbsp; It also displays artistic merit in its reinvention of the Victorian cottage-row type associated with the long narrow lot on which it was originally located to maximize internal space, access to sunlight through its setting close to the north edge of the lot and its uncharacteristic side entrance which eliminates wasteful corridor space while maximizing landscaped open-space.&nbsp; The building demonstrates both a high degree of artistic merit and craftsmanship in the design of the windows, in their varying scales, folded planes and patterning of the mullions which indicate a hierarchy of interior spaces.&nbsp; The second floor window on the south-west corner adds to the building's prominence on the street. The architectural elements of the exterior including the massing with its recessed bays, the cladding of horizontal siding associated with the Victorian cottage and the large-scale, plywood panels associated with industrial loft spaces, and the use of columns as expressive elements related to the movement of people display a high degree of artistic merit.&nbsp; The building displays a high degree of artistic merit and craftsmanship on the part of the architects, the contractor and the client as they resolved the design and construction of the building on a restricted budget through careful planning and the selection of methods and material to produce an award-winning and world-renowned live-work space proving that great architecture and exceptional housing can be achieved on a tight budget.
The Craven Road Studio displays a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit in its reinterpretation of an ancillary building-garage typology to create an award-winning private gallery and studio space dedicated to exhibition, display and research.&nbsp; The single volume space is enriched through its section which includes a border of coffered sky-lights illuminating the space with natural light and whose architectural expression correspond to the thick walls of the studio which accommodate storage on two-sides.&nbsp; The recessed entry, adjacent bay window on the west wall and long narrow window set in deep splayed recess on the north wall add a rich spatial complexity to a single volume of space.&nbsp; The diffuse natural light set in the maple clad coffers on all four walls is complimented by the view through the full height tempered glass window facing the landscaped courtyard to the west and the narrow view of the rear garden to the north of the studio.&nbsp; The combination of materials, polished concrete floors, white walls, and maple-faced coffers extend the material palette of the workspace in the house and provide a light and warm space in which to conduct research and view exhibitions in all seasons.&nbsp; On the exterior the use of large, stained, marine plywood panels with the grain running horizontally[2] relates the studio to the house, while the weathered cedar slats at the attic level of the studio and on the fences, and the neighbours' garage creates a cohesive backdrop to the open spaces.
The setting of the property at 1007 Craven Road, containing the Craven Road House and Studio displays a high degree of artistic merit through the placement of the house, the studio and the new garage, constructed for the neighbours, to maximize the potential for a sequence of landscaped open spaces which are viewed by the house and studio and contribute to the amenity of Craven Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Craven Road House displays a high degree of technical achievement in its design and construction which were accomplished on a restricted budget and achieve high architectural results from both an artistic and functional standard.&nbsp; The house also displays a high degree of technical achievement as following the adoption of the Ontario Building Code in 1975, it was one of the first structures in the City of Toronto to adopt a performance-based approach to building cladding, specifying wood cladding with cement board on the north fa&ccedil;ade providing the required two-hour fire resistance. In this way codes were met, costs were reduced and architectural expression was achieved.&nbsp;
The Craven Road Studio displays a high degree of technical achievement in the innovative design of its coffered skylights which reduce ultra-violet glare which would be damaging to sensitive materials on display.&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 1007 Craven Road is valued for its association with Robert G. Hill, the Chief Editor and Author of the Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800-1950 (BDAC), the definitive resource for scholars and the public on the career and work of all architects working in Canada from 1800-1950. Painstakingly researched for over four decades, the BDAC is a free online database that provides detailed and accurate documentation on the career and work of over 2,500 architects active in Canada from 1800-1950, including foreign architects that have contributed to the Canadian built environment. It also profiles over 85,000 buildings across Canada. The BDAC remains unmatched as a resource on architect-designed buildings in Canada and presently receives over 5,000 hits per month from all over the world.
Hill's contribution to the field of architectural history are vast and he has received numerous honours and awards throughout his career including the Architectural Technologists Alumni Award, the Toronto Architectural Guild Medal, the CMHC Travelling Scholarship, the Goulstone Fellowship in Architecture, the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario's (ACO) Eric Arthur Lifetime Achievement Award (2016), the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA) Order of da Vinci Medal (2012), and he became a Fellow of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 2011.
Designed by Shim-Sutcliffe Architects Inc. the Craven Road House and Studio reflect the work and ideas of the partnership of Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe particularly in its commitment to place-making in its response to the context and creation of a lush landscaped outdoor spaces as well as in its commitment to urban infill and the intensification and densification of cities while enhancing the quality of neighbourhoods.&nbsp; The design of both the house and the studio reflect the partnership's innovative approach to architectural briefs while creating carefully planned spaces which are made more beautiful through the nuanced use of natural light and a variety of views, extending the expressive potential of materials, and imbuing their projects with a high level of craftsmanship.&nbsp; Members of the Order of Canada and awarded with the RAIC Gold medal, the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal and 15 Governor General's Awards and Medals for their work as architects, educators and advocates, with a body of work that has been widely published and exhibited, as well as being the subject of a documentary film, nationally and internationally, there can be no doubt of their significance and not only to the architectural community.&nbsp;&nbsp; Published over 38 times, after 25 years, the Craven Road House continues to be a requested case study house by architecture students from around the world.&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The development of the property at 1007 Craven Road with the modestly scaled, wood-clad, two-storey house and single-storey studio reinforces the character and built form of the street by maintaining set-backs, scale and massing of the mix of houses and garages that line Craven Road.&nbsp; In the careful development of the landscaped open spaces on the property, it contributes a well-treed mid-block, green lung which enhances the quality of the street's environment.&nbsp;
Located on the east side of Craven Road, the subject property at 1007 Craven Road is physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to its surroundings. Historically known as Erie Terrace prior to the renaming of the street to Craven Road in 1924, the subject property is reflective of the historic configuration of this narrow laneway, which contained properties with frontages only on the east side of the street from Danforth Avenue to Queen Street East. This unique configuration comprising the street remains largely in-tact today on Craven Road from Danforth Avenue to Hanson Street.
The Craven Road House and Studio are architectural landmarks of cultural significance for their contribution to design excellence in Canada and globally.&nbsp; Recognized by the professional architectural community with a Governor General's Award (house) and Medal (studio) and widely published in architectural journals and anthologies in North America and Europe, they are meaningful to the community and are widely renowned as they represent a high standard of excellence for their aesthetic qualities but also for their technical and typological inventiveness and for achieving this within a limited budget for a client with restricted means and an ambitious and specific program.&nbsp; For these reasons they are landmarks which are culturally rather than geographically significant.&nbsp;

2972,Notice of Intention to Designate – 141 Bathurst Street ,"IN THE MATTER OF THE ONTARIO HERITAGE ACT R.S.O. 1990, CHAPTER O.18 AND CITY OF TORONTO, PROVINCE OF ONTARIO - 141 BATHURST STREET",2021-12-23 05:00:00,"TAKE NOTICE that Council for the City of Toronto intends to designate the property, including the lands, buildings and structures thereon known municipally as 141 Bathurst Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.O.18, as amended, as a property of cultural heritage value or interest.
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 141 Bathurst Street, (entrance address 581 Richmond Street West) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The property at 141 Bathurst Street is located near the south-east corner of Bathurst Street and Richmond Street West in the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp; A two-storey, brick-clad factory in the Industrial Classical style was constructed in 1900 for E. C. Walker and Sons Ltd., hat manufacturers, and extended between 1910 and 1913. Located in a rear yard behind the houses facing Richmond Street West (then known as Farley Avenue), the property was originally accessed through laneways and was known as 159-163 Farley Avenue and by 1913 as 587 Richmond Street West.&nbsp; The Walker property was extended, c.1949, with the purchase of the property at 141 Bathurst Street providing access from Bathurst Street. After 1954 the original 19th-century house at 141 Bathurst was demolished and replaced with a parking lot. E. C. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. maintained the address at 587 Richmond Street West, referencing the address at 141 Bathurst Street as the company storeroom.
&nbsp;
The property is identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2017 and currently under appeal. It was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2017.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1900 with later extensions, the E. C. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. hat factory at 141 Bathurst Street has design value as a well-crafted example of the factory-warehouse type which emerged in Toronto in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Walker family factory exhibits the characteristic features of the type in the long, narrow, flat-roofed two-storey volumes forming an L-shape around the rear single-storey wing. The facades with their long, rectangular windows, arranged in pairs between half-pilasters, are expressive of the internal post-and-beam factory structure.&nbsp; The regular bays of the half-pilasters and the principal entry with its broad elliptical arch, glazed fanlight and sidelights (currently without glazing) represent elements of Georgian classicism which render the Walker factory a fine example of Industrial Classicism.&nbsp; The choice of buff brick cladding is shared with local landmarks including the adjacent St. Mary's church and school buildings constructed in the 1870s through the 1890s, the Joseph Mulvey house of 1869 and its adjoining, later, St. Mary's Arts and Letters Club of 1909 (now known as the Factory Theatre). In its setting, the Walker factory is distinctively atypical as it was constructed in a rear yard behind the houses facing Richmond and Bathurst Streets, benefitting from the laneway which lead to its principal west fa&ccedil;ade and maintaining access via an additional laneway to a rear service yard from Richmond Street.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 141 Bathurst Street has historical value for its association with E. C. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. a family-based, hat-making company which originated in the late 1870s and endured until the 1960s.&nbsp; The business was rooted in the millinery and dress-making enterprise initiated by Sarah J. Walker c. 1875, and flourished as 'E. C. and S. J. Walker' in a shop on Queen Street West when her husband Edwin C. Walker, a cabinet-maker, joined her enterprise by 1889.&nbsp; In 1900, the Walkers purchased the property now known as 141 Bathurst Street and built the hat factory for E. C. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd., including their sons, Edwin E. and Homer H. Walker in the operations.&nbsp; When Sarah Walker closed her business on Queen Street in 1903, their son, Stanley Walker, took over the premises with his furrier company. E. C. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. continued to operate as hat and cap makers and later as manufacturers of hat and bonnet frames and suppliers until they sold the premises in 1966.&nbsp; Through their 65 years of operation, E. C. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. were part of the early transformation of the King-Spadina district from a residential and institutional neighbourhood to Toronto's premium manufacturing hub, acquiring its Fashion District moniker.&nbsp; Following the sale of the property in 1966, the factory continued to be used as a warehouse through the 1980s.&nbsp; By 1990, it was part of the renaissance of the King-Spadina neighbourhood through its adaptive re-use as artist and photographers studios, typesetter&rsquo;s shop and as office space including tenants such as the Toronto Arts Council and Artscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1900, the E. C. Walker &amp; Sons factory building is important as it maintains and supports the late 19th and early 20th-century industrial character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood through it low-rise scale, brick cladding and factory typology features combined with classical elements. Set back from the street, and viewed from both Richmond Street West and Bathurst Street, its unusual setting is indicative of the evolving history of the neighbourhood as industrial uses began to predominate in the former residential and institutional neighbourhood.
&nbsp;
For over 120 years, the E. C. Walker &amp; Sons factory building has been physically, functionally and historically linked to its surroundings, initially as a contributor to the City's manufacturing hub and emerging Fashion District and for the past 50 years as part of the regeneration of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as a vibrant commercial and cultural centre.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 2365 Bayview Avenue, the Frank P. Wood estate, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 2365 Bayview Avenue, originally known as the Frank P. Wood estate and now as the Crescent School, is one of a sequence of grand estates, constructed between 1909 and 1940, on the forested ravine above the western branch of the Don River, in the Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills neighbourhood.&nbsp; The 30-acre property was purchased in 1928 by Frank P. Wood, the financier, art collector and major benefactor of the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario).&nbsp; Wood commissioned the New York firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich Architects who designed a meticulously-detailed Georgian Revival house set within a picturesque complex with a forecourt, service-garage building and second garage, clad in limestone and slate, with terraces, and formal gardens, perched on a ridge above the ravine landscape of the west branch of the Don River.&nbsp; A painting studio, designed as a log cabin by the architect Gordon Gibson and set on the slope of the ravine, was later commissioned by Emma Wood, Frank P. Wood's wife.&nbsp; On Wood's death in 1955 the estate was bequeathed to the Art Gallery of Toronto.&nbsp; It was purchased in 1967 by the Crescent School who have altered the interior of the original buildings, extending the second garage building and have added a number of large educational buildings, maintaining most of the original complex, setting and landscape features.&nbsp; The cluster of four columns set in the garden were relocated in 1970 from the previous location of the Crescent School, the Dentonia Park estate and the surrounding garden was refurbished in 2013 to mark the school's centennial.
&nbsp;
The property was originally listed on the North York Inventory of Heritage Properties in 1998 and following municipal amalgamation included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2006.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1930, the Frank P. Wood estate, at 2365 Bayview Avenue, has design value as a very fine representative of one of the Bayview estates constructed in the early 20th century and featuring a cluster of architect-designed buildings including a large main house and service-garage buildings whose architecture extended in designed, landscape features, such as the curvilinear drive leading to the forecourt, the terrace, lawns with formal plantings and log and stone cabin, all laid-out in response to the ridge and treed, ravine landscape of the west branch of the Don River.
&nbsp;
The main house, is an excellent representative of the Georgian Revival style, constructed in the early 20th-century, and has been deemed to be ""one of the finest Georgian Revival houses in Canada.""[1]&nbsp; Characteristic elements of the style are present in the rectangular, two-and-a-half-storey volume with its gable roof, and symmetrical disposition of elements including the central entrances on its primary west and east elevations, flanked by double-hung sash windows or French doors, limestone cladding with quoin details, paired chimneys, and in a nod to the Georgian architecture of New England, a cupola, reinforcing the symmetry, of the slate roof. The octagonal second-storey window introduces an Art Deco element typical of the period in which the house is built, but which is sympathetic to the Georgian style in its symmetrical form which highlights the axial position of the main entrance and repeats the octagonal plan of the cupola above. The random-coursing of limestone cladding is another element which indicates the early 20th century period of the house.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The log cabin, commissioned by Emma Wood, the wife of Frank, as a day-time retreat and painting studio, has value as a representative of a log cabin type, with its single storey, gable-roofed form with a verandah, three walls of log cladding combined with a fourth wall of stone including the stone chimney.
&nbsp;
A high degree of craftsmanship is displayed in the detailing of the house including the limestone cladding with its quoins and precisely laid random coursing, main entrances, doors and door cases. The interiors of the house also display a high degree of craftsmanship in their door and window cases, fireplace surrounds, and in the wall panelling with dado, panels with picture lights and decorative cornices.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
A high degree of artistic merit is displayed in the two service-garage buildings as their design responds to the main house in their use of the same materials, limestone and slate and differentiates them as subsidiary to the main house through their lower scale, hipped, instead of gabled roof form and on the south face of the service-garage building facing the forecourt, in its modest and more rural character and minimal architectural elements evident in the design of the windows and single roof dormer.&nbsp; Its large arched opening is indicative of its original function as a vehicular passage to the garages facing the service forecourt.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property has historical and associative value as it was the home of Frank Porter Wood (1882-1955) a successful Toronto financier and philanthropist.&nbsp; An early and avid collector of European paintings, Wood was a major benefactor of the Art Gallery of Toronto (now known as the Art Gallery of Ontario) donating important works during his lifetime and on his death, works of global importance, the proceeds from the sale of his estate to fund the acquisition of art for the gallery.&nbsp; The gallery acknowledged his generous patronage with the creation of the Frank P. Wood Gallery.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property also has historic and associative value as it is one of the several large estates constructed along or adjacent to Bayview Avenue in the Bridle Path-Sunnybrook neighbourhood in the early 20th century.&nbsp; These estates, with their grand houses and out-buildings designed by leading architects which were responsive to the ravine landscapes of the west Don River represent a particular development in the newly incorporated Township of North York as it was undergoing transformation from its 19th century origins as vast tracts of farmland.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property has historical and associative value with the Crescent School, which has owned the property since 1970.&nbsp; During the past 50 years the school has demonstrated their stewardship of the property's heritage through their adaptive re-use of the original residential estate buildings, including the main house, the garage-service building, the garage, the log cabin and the landscape features including the curvilinear drive, forecourt, service court and lawn.&nbsp; New educational buildings added to the property have been sympathetic to the original estate buildings in siting, form and materials.
&nbsp;
The Frank P. Wood estate was designed by the New York firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich Architects.&nbsp; The partnership of William Adams Delano (1874-1960) and Chester Holmes Aldrich (1871-1940) lasted from 1903-1940.&nbsp; Their work reflected their training at the Paris Ecole des Beaux Arts and internship at the influential New York firm of Carrere &amp; Hastings.&nbsp; They were particularly renowned for their country house designs for the U. S. east coast elite including the Vanderbilt, Astor, Rockefeller and Whitney families and for their Georgian Revival style, both of which are reflected at the Wood estate, their only known Toronto-based commission.
&nbsp;
Located on the east side of Bayview Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue in the Bridle Path-Sunnybrook neighbourhood, the property has contextual value as it defines and maintains the landscaped and treed, ravine setting of the west branch of the Don River and the original Frank P Wood estate, one of the original country estates which have been characteristic of this part of North York since its incorporation.&nbsp; As with many of the surrounding former private estates, the Wood estate is characteristic as it has been adaptively re-used for institutional purposes, in this case for the Crescent School, resulting in the addition of new buildings and modification to the original landscaped setting.&nbsp; Constructed in 1930, the Frank P. Wood estate is physically and historically linked to its surroundings representing that ""brief period of about thirty years, from 1925-1955, the Bayview area was a delightful pastoral suburb on the edge of a burgeoning city.""&nbsp;

The property at 579 Richmond Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 579 Richmond Street West, located on the south side of Richmond Street West between Portland Street and Bathurst Street, contains a factory building constructed in 1913 to the designs of the architect Isadore Feldman in the Industrial Classical style for the Independent Cloak Co. Originally constructed as a five-and-a-half-storey factory, following a fire in 1914, it was reconstructed as four-and-a-half storeys.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property is identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2017 and currently under appeal. It was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2017.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The Independent Cloak Co. building has design value as a fine example of the factory type, designed in the Industrial Classical style which proliferated in the factories of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century. The factory typology is present in the flat-roofed, rectangular massing of the four-and-a-half-storey volume, brick cladding, windows arranged in a grid pattern expressive of the internal post and beam structure and its manufacturing function. Additional factory features include the loading dock on the west elevation, adjacent to the elevator, and the raised roof parapet concealing the elevator housing. The Industrial Classical style is present in the modulation of the factory design through the articulation of the principal (north) fa&ccedil;ade with a series of brick pilasters stretching the height of the fa&ccedil;ade from the cast stone base to the cornice with corbelled, segmentally-headed arches at the top, decorative corbelling and a stone belt course beneath the first floor windows and projecting brick panels beneath each window in the upper stories.&nbsp; The classical style of the stone framing of the door (now mostly painted over) with its deep recess, corbel brackets, and moulded mutule blocks beneath a plain cornice topped by a stone tablet with a simple recessed panel are further elements which elevate the public, street-facing fa&ccedil;ade of the factory with the civic language of classicism and contribute to the Industrial Classical style.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property has historical value for its contribution to the development of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as Toronto's manufacturing and employment hub from the early to mid-20th century.&nbsp; Its adaptive re-use as office and studio space from the 1980s forward was part of the renaissance of King-Spadina. Following a common practice of factory development and enterprise in the neighbourhood, Joseph Bockneck and Louis Fluxgold, proprietors of the Independent Cloak Company commissioned the building as a factory for themselves which would be supported by additional tenants.&nbsp; Although the Independent Cloak Co. sold the property following the fire in 1914, the building continued to be important in the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it was the location for a variety of manufacturing enterprises over the next 60-70 years related to the garment industry as well as the automotive and upholstery industries.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The Independent Cloak Co. is valued as it represents the work of the architect Isadore Feldman (1887-1919) during the period when he operated as a sole practitioner and had a predominance of factory commissions for Jewish clients working in the garment industry. Along with the Independent Cloak Co. these commissions included the Cooper Cap Co., 1911, at Spadina and Grange avenues, the American Hat Frame Co, 1912, at Bathurst and Wellington streets, the Imperial Clothing Co., 1913, Richmond Street West, the Tip Top Tailors Block, 1914, Richmond Street West. Feldman's work contributed to the emergence of the garment industry in the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it gained its Fashion District identity.&nbsp; His work represents the growing economic importance of the Jewish community to the city's manufacturing economy.&nbsp; The 1911, Adath Israel Jewish Synagogue, designed by Feldman and located on Centre Avenue near Agnes Street, in the 'Ward' contributed to the establishment of Jewish religious and cultural life in the early 20th century and its representation in the City of Toronto.
&nbsp;
Located on the south side of Richmond Street West between Portland Street and Bathurst Street, the Independent Cloak Co. building has, since 1913, contributed to defining and maintaining the late 19th and early 20th-century industrial character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood through its low-rise, rectangular massing, brick cladding with classical elements of its factory typology.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
For over 100 years, the Independent Cloak Co. factory building has been physically, functionally and historically linked to its surroundings, initially as a contributor to the City's manufacturing and employment hub and emerging Fashion District and for the past 40 years as part of the regeneration of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as a vibrant commercial and cultural centre.&nbsp;

Description
The property at 516 Yonge Street (including the entrance address at 514 Yonge Street) is located on the west side of Yonge Street, in the block between Grosvenor and Breadalbane Streets. It contains a mixed-use/commercial brick building constructed c. 1876 and altered in 1924, which retains its original scale, form, and massing as a 2-1/2-storey building with a mansard roof, along with architectural details from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

&nbsp;
The property was listed on the City of Toronto Heritage Register on March 10, 2016, and is identified as a contributing property in the Historic Yonge Street Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2016 and currently under appeal.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Originally constructed as two shops circa 1876 and renovated in 1924, the property at 516 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value as a representative example of the fine-grained mixed-use/commercial building typology that emerged along Yonge Street, north of College Street, in the late-19th century and persisted until the mid-20th century. Although altered, the property is one of the earliest surviving buildings on the block between Grosvenor and Breadalbane Streets, and retains its original scale, form, and massing as a 2-1/2-storey building with a mansard roof, along with architectural details from the late 19th and early 20th centuries on its principal (east) elevation, including storefronts at grade (which have been altered), two bays of triple windows at the second storey, a projecting cornice/eaves above the second storey, and a mansard roof framed by end parapet firewalls and featuring two arched dormers inset with triple windows.
&nbsp;
Contextually, the commercial building at 516 Yonge Street is valued for its contribution to the character of Yonge Street, north of College Street, which is typified by the surviving mixed-use/commercial and public buildings that were erected here during the first wave of construction in the late 19th century. This character is typified by 3-storey heights, narrow building frontages, no setback from the street, flat or mansard roof profiles, brick construction with stone and wood detailing, storefronts at grade, and a variety of late-19th-century stylistic vocabularies, including Georgian, Italianate, Romanesque and Second Empire.
&nbsp;
The contextual value of the commercial building at 516 Yonge Street is also related to its historical and visual links to its surroundings on the west side of Yonge Street between Grosvenor and Breadalbane Streets.

&nbsp;
Description
The property at 526 Yonge Street (including the entrance addresses at 528 Yonge Street and 7 Breadalbane Street) is located at the southwest corner of Yonge and Breadalbane Streets. It contains a 2-1/2 and 2-storey mixed-use/commercial brick building at the southwest corner of Yonge and Breadalbane Streets, which was designed in the Second Empire style by the architects McCaw &amp; Lennox, and constructed circa 1881.
&nbsp;
In recognition of its architectural significance, the building was amongst some of the earliest included on the City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in March 1974.
&nbsp;
Surrounding properties recognized on the Heritage Register include the commercial building at 480 Yonge Street (1864), the Yonge Street Fire Hall Clock Tower at 484 Yonge Street (1871), the Bank of Montreal Building at 496 Yonge Street (1887), and several late-19th-century commercial blocks to the north and south, including 502-508 Yonge Street (mid-1860s), 538-544 Yonge Street (circa1873-74), 546-550 Yonge Street (circa 1885-86) and 527-535 Yonge Street (circa 1880s).
&nbsp;
In 2016, the property was identified as a contributing property in the Historic Yonge Street Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council and currently under appeal.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Dating to circa 1881, the property at 526 Yonge Street has design and physical value as a representative example of the Second Empire architectural style that was popular in many prominent commercial, public, and residential buildings in Toronto from 1860 to 1900. The property retains its original scale, form, and massing as a 2-1/2-storey building with a 2-storey rear wing, and its design value as a representative example of the Second Empire style is reflected in many of its extant original features, including its brick construction with ornamental stone and wood details, mansard roof featuring a central tower and shed-roofed dormers framed by decorative trim, and highly symmetrical principal (east) fa&ccedil;ade featuring three bays of windows separated by brick pilasters, a central bay of paired windows surmounted by a pediment, and a continuous entablature below the eaves line.
&nbsp;
Originally constructed as two commercial units, the property at 526 Yonge Street also has cultural heritage value as an early surviving example of the fine-grained mixed-use/commercial building typology that emerged along Yonge Street, north of College Street, during a period of accelerated development in the late 19th century.
&nbsp;
The properties are valued for their association with the significant Toronto architectural firm of McCaw &amp; Lennox, who designed the two stores at 526 Yonge Street in the Second Empire style that characterized much of the firm's work during their brief partnership from 1876-1881. Established in 1876 by prominent Toronto architect E.J. Lennox (1854-1933) and William Frederick McCaw (1850-1923), the firm was immediately successful, and received commissions for large churches, schools, commercial buildings, and residential houses in Toronto and throughout Southern Ontario. The firm's notable projects include the Wellesley Public School (1876), the layout and landscaping of Queen's Park (1876), Occident Hall (1876), the Bond Street Congregational Church (1879), and Hotel Hanlan on Toronto Island (1879-81).
&nbsp;
After the partnership dissolved in 1881, Lennox would go on to build one of the most successful architectural practices in Canada by 1885. Lennox is credited with building some of the city's most significant landmarks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Toronto Athletic Club (1894), Old City Hall (1899), the King Edward Hotel (1901-03), the West Wing of the Ontario Legislative Building (1909), Casa Loma (1911) and St. Paul&rsquo;s Anglican Church (1913).
&nbsp;
Anchoring the southwest corner of Yonge and Breadalbane Streets and retaining many of its original architectural features, the building at 526 Yonge Street has contextual value for its contribution to the character of Yonge Street, north of College Street, which is typified by the surviving commercial and public buildings that were erected during the first wave of construction in the late 19th century. This character is generally expressed by 3-storey heights, narrow building frontages, no setback from the street, flat or mansard roof profiles, brick construction with stone and wood detailing, storefronts at grade, and a variety of late-19th-century stylistic vocabularies, including Georgian, Italianate, Romanesque and Second Empire.
&nbsp;
The contextual value of the commercial building at 526 Yonge Street is also related to its historical and visual links to its surroundings on the west side of Yonge Street between Grosvenor and Breadalbane Streets.

&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Dating to circa 1910, the property 147 Church Street has design and physical value as a representative example of the Edwardian Classicism architectural style that was popular for commercial buildings in Toronto in the early 20th century. The property retains its original scale, form, and massing as a 3-storey building, and its design value as a representative example of the Edwardian Classicism style is reflected in many of its extant original features, including its simple, balanced design featuring a rectangular plan and massing, flat roof, brick construction, and symmetrical primary (west) elevation. The building's restrained classical detailing includes its organization into two bays of three windows, separated by brick piers, with rectangular second-storey windows featuring stone sills and lintels linking the pilasters, and arched third-storey windows featuring brick voussoirs with keystones and stone sills linking the pilasters. Above the third storey, the building also features corbelled brick banding with brackets connecting into the keystones of third-storey windows, a dentilated pressed-metal cornice, and two semi-circular parapets.
&nbsp;
Originally constructed with two commercial units on the ground floor and a rooming house above, the property at 147 Church Street also has cultural heritage value as an early surviving example of the fine-grained mixed-use/commercial building typology that emerged along Church Street, north of Queen Street East, during the early 20th century.
&nbsp;
The property is valued for its association with significant Toronto contractor and businessman Joseph Wright, who owned the property between 1899 and 1948. Wright built the existing building at 147 Church Street circa 1910, which he operated as an income property, renting out the ground floor commercial units, along with upper-storey apartments, known as the Excelsior Apartments. Born in England in 1849, Wright immigrated to Toronto with his parents in 1857, and later founded the Bennett &amp; Wright Co. Ltd., a Toronto contracting firm that rose to prominence in the late 19th century. As contractors providing plumbing, heating, lighting, and electrical fixtures, Wright and his firm played a significant role in constructing many landmark buildings in Toronto, and throughout Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their notable commissions include the New City Hall building (Toronto), the King Edward Hotel (Toronto), Union Station (Toronto), the Temple Building (Toronto), the Mount Alliston University buildings (New Brunswick), the Grand Trunk Railway building (Montreal), the Parliament buildings (Victoria, B. C.), the Guelph Agricultural College buildings, and the Ridley College buildings (St. Catharines).

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 545 Lake Shore Boulevard West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, historical/associative value, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Constructed in 1927 as an office and manufacturing plant for Crosse &amp; Blackwell, the property at 545 Lake Shore Boulevard West features a 2.5-storey pavilion with a hexagonal footprint, prominently situated at the corner of Bathurst Street and Lake Shore Boulevard West. To the east, two 3.5-storey wings meet at an obtuse angle, effectively forming a partial hexagon in plan that echoes the front pavilion. The building was constructed on a concrete pile foundation with a primarily red brick exterior and cast-stone detailing.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property demonstrates a unique application of Art Deco and Beaux Arts stylistic elements to an industrial headquarters. It is especially notable for its unusual footprint and form, comprising a 2.5-storey hexagonal pavilion that includes the main entry, and two 3.5-storey wings that create a partial hexagon in plan. The building's red brick masonry features such decorative details as cast-stone banding with geometric and floral motifs and the initials of original occupant Crosse &amp; Blackwell. Though alterations have resulted in minor impacts to the building's architectural integrity, including the removal of glazing from the pavilion's lantern and of cast-stone detailing from the wings' upper storey, the building remains a strong example of 1920s-era architectural design.
&nbsp;
The property holds direct associations with the theme of Toronto's waterfront development, as an early construction project (1927) on the Central Waterfront lands created by the Toronto Harbour Commission through land reclamation. The building was intended to contribute to the identity of Lake Shore Boulevard West (then Fleet Street) as an important waterfront thoroughfare across Toronto. The property is strongly connected with Crosse &amp; Blackwell, representing the investment of a centuries-old British foodstuffs company in Canada. The property also represents an early example of adaptive reuse; after the building was listed on the municipal heritage register and acquired by the Harbourfront Corporation in 1973, it was successfully reused as a media centre associated with CFMT-TV and OMNI-TV from 1979 to 2009.
&nbsp;
The Crosse &amp; Blackwell Building demonstrates the work of architects Chapman and Oxley, as one of a number of prominent commissions within their portfolio of commercial, industrial, and institutional works. Chapman, in particular, was closely associated with the Toronto Harbour Commission and designed a number of other significant waterfront buildings.&nbsp;
The Crosse &amp; Blackwell Building defines and is linked to its surroundings as one of the earliest examples of industrial development in the Central Harbour area. The building was intended to have a strong presence on the major thoroughfare of Lake Shore Boulevard West (originally Fleet Street) where it intersects with Bathurst Street. It maintains this visual prominence through its distinctive architecture and corner siting, and is considered an architectural landmark.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 10 and 10A Dawes Road (including an active entrance at 10B Dawes Road) are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
The properties at 10 and 10A Dawes Road are located on the west side of Dawes Road at the southern termination of the road, south of Danforth Avenue and north of the railway corridor. They were formerly a single property spanning three lots at 10 Dawes Road but were severed to become 10 and 10A Dawes Road in 1964. Historically, the area at the corner of Danforth Avenue and Dawes Road was the location of several historic settlements with inns, hotels, and stores, including the village of Dawes' Corners in 1850, followed by Smith's Corner in the 1860s, Little York and Coleman's Corner in the 1880s, and the Town of East Toronto in 1903.
&nbsp;
10A Dawes Road, the earlier of the two structures, is comprised of a two-and-a-half-storey brick building fronting Dawes Road with a one-storey attached brick building at the rear. The property was constructed in c.1895 and originally functioned as a grist and flour mill with the one-storey attached building at the rear housing the steam mechanism that powered the mill. It was likely originally occupied by the East Toronto Milling Company. 10 Dawes Road, which was constructed in 1905 to the south of 10A Dawes Road, is comprised of a three-storey building fronting Dawes Road. It is concrete and stucco at grade level with the upper-storeys and headspace clad in corrugated metal. At the rear is a one-storey concrete block addition and a one-storey metal clad addition. This property originally housed the grain elevator. The Chalmers Milling Company owned and operated out of 10 and 10A Dawes Road from 1905 until the properties were sold to the Elizabeth Flour &amp; Seed Milling Co. in 1952. The company continued to occupy the properties10A and 10 Dawes Road for 29-years until they were sold and adaptively reused in 1981 and 2007 respectively. More recently, the Silver Mill Gallery, which offered programs for Toronto's emerging digital artists, occupied the space at 10 Dawes Road.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Design and Physical Value
The property at 10A Dawes Road is valued as a rare surviving example of the grist and flour mill building type in the historic village of Little York and the Town of East Toronto. It was purpose-built to process grain and is comprised of a two-and-a-half-storey box-form brick building with a one-storey box-form northern brick building at the rear that housed the steam mechanism that powered the mill. After the grain elevator was constructed to the south abutting 10A Dawes Road, connections would have been created between the buildings to have allowed the sorted grain to be delivered from the grain elevator at 10 Dawes Road to the mill at 10A Dawes Road to be milled.
&nbsp;
At the exterior, where various alterations have been made to door and window openings, original segmental-arches are present throughout the side (north), principal (east), and rear (west) elevations of the two-and-a-half-storey structure fronting Dawes Road, as well as in the rear (west) one-storey brick structure. Additional ornamentation is present in the principal (east) elevation of the building fronting Dawes Road in the parapet, which contains stepped corbelling and an inlaid rectangular panel. A simplified version of this parapet ornamentation can be seen side (north) elevation of the one-storey building at the rear.
&nbsp;
The property at 10 Dawes Road is valued as a rare surviving example of the grain elevator building type in the historic village of Little York and the Town of East Toronto. It is also valued as a rare surviving example of a grain elevator built in a wooden-crib form, a construction style that was replaced during the 1920s by concrete grain terminals and later, by steel. The three-storey box-form structure was purpose-built to raise grain from a pit below the basement at the southeast corner and then elevate it through the building into nine storage silos where it could be kept before being milled in the neighbouring structure at 10A Dawes Road. The ground floor of the interior of the building contains timber support columns with capitals ornamented with a stepped reverse-ziggurat pattern that ascend in size. Also still extant at the interior is the wheel and rubber conveyor belt housed in the headhouse, which sits one-storey above the flat roof, and the nine wooden-cribbed grain silos.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The properties at both 10 and 10A Dawes Road are valued for their association with the theme of the railway and the subsequent activity of milling, which were significant in the development of the village of Little York during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. The opening of Grand Trunk Railway's (GTR) freight yard and roundhouse to the south of the subject properties and the relocation of York Station to Dawes Road, significantly contributed to the early wave of residential subdivision and industrialization of the area. It made the area appealing for the construction of a mill because of its close proximity to the railway. Directly from the railway cars, grain would travel into the subject properties &ndash; first into 10A Dawes Road and later into 10 Dawes Road once it was constructed &ndash; where it would be stored until it was ready to be milled next door.
&nbsp;
The subject properties have value for their ability to yield information that contributes to our understanding of the development of various historic settlements near the GTR tracks at the corner of Danforth Avenue and Dawes Road from the mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth centuries. First the location of Dawes' Corners in 1850, followed by Smith's Corner in 1870, and Little York and Coleman's Corner from the 1880s until the annexation of Little York to the Town of East Toronto in 1903, the corner was a popular location for the construction of local inns and stores for several decades.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The subject properties at 10 and 10A Dawes Road are physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to their surroundings at the southern termination of Dawes Road, which was strategically selected as the location for a mill and grain elevator because of their proximity to the GTR rail corridor. The relationship of the properties to their setting is demonstrated by the placement, setback and orientation of the mill building and grain elevator on the west side of Dawes Road south of Danforth Avenue, where there was historically a railway spur by 1924 that rose to the south edge of the grain elevator building.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 241 Richmond Street West (including the entrance addresses at 239 Richmond Street West and 137, 139, 141 and 145 John Street)&nbsp;is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
Description
The property at 241 Richmond Street West is located in the King-Spadina area.
Located on the southeast corner of John Street and Richmond Street, the property at 241 Richmond Street West contains a two-storey commercial building constructed in three phases (1936, 1940 and 1948) in the Art Moderne style and designed by the leading Toronto architecture firm, Page &amp; Steele.
The property was included on the City's Heritage Register on December 5, 2017.&nbsp;
It is also identified as a contributing property in the King-Spadina HCD Plan (2017) that is currently under appeal.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property at 241 Richmond Street West has cultural heritage value for its design as a detached commercial building associated with the second wave of development in the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the 20th century. The detached commercial building represents a key building typology in King-Spadina, dating to the early to mid-1900s when the area was the city&rsquo;s main industrial district and filled with large-scale warehouses, factories and office buildings, many of which replaced earlier low-rise structures. The building at 241 Richmond Street West is distinguished by its Art Moderne design, particularly the stepped parapets on the columns organizing the oversized openings facing Richmond and John streets.&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 241 Richmond Street West is also valued for its association with Walter Harland Steele of Page &amp; Steele Architects who designed the original 1936 building for Handy and Harman of Canada Limited in 1936 to house its precious metal and alloy refinery. Page &amp; Steele would also contribute the seamlessly integrated 1940 and 1948 additions to the original building. The Art Moderne styling of the building at 241 Richmond Street West reflects the design aesthetic of architect Walter Harland Steele, whose architectural firm, Page &amp; Steele, is recognized as one of Toronto&rsquo;s leading architecture offices.
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property at 241 Richmond Street West is valued for the role of the detached commercial building in defining, supporting and maintaining the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, reflecting its evolution from a 19th-century residential and institutional enclave and Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing centre in the 20th century, to its current status as a mixed-use community.&nbsp;
The detached commercial building at 241 Richmond Street west is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting in the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it anchors the southeast corner of John Street and, on the north, faces the Wesley Building (1913), a local landmark filling part of the block bounded by Richmond, John and Queen Streets.
Heritage Attributes of 241 Richmond Street West:&nbsp;&nbsp;

The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of John Street&nbsp;
The scale, form and massing of the two-storey rectangular-shaped plan
The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork&nbsp;
The materials, with the brick cladding and detailing (the brickwork has been painted)&nbsp;
On the west elevation on John Street, the brick piers with the stepped parapets that organize the wall into four bays, the large flat-headed openings in both storeys with the stone lintels, stone sills on the second-storey window openings and the fluted, cast stone jamb detail in the second bay at ground level
The north elevation on Richmond Street West, which extends five bays and has flat-headed openings organized by brick piers (some of the openings have been altered and the piers removed)&nbsp;

Note: The south side elevation adjoins the neighbouring building. No heritage attributes are identified on the rear (east) elevation, which is viewed from Richmond Street West.
Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate
Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Administrator, Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: hertpb@toronto.ca within thirty days of February 8, 2022, which is March 10, 2022.

The property at 133 John Street has cultural heritage value for its design as a residential building with Second Empire styling associated with the first wave of development in the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the 19th century. The detached house represents a key building typology in King-Spadina, which originated in the 1800s as a residential and institutional enclave where the side streets and many of the main streets were lined with detached, semi-detached and row houses. The subject property survived the replacement of much of the residential building stock during the second phase of development of the community in the 20th century when King-Spadina became Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre. The building at 133 John Street is distinguished by its Second Empire design, particularly the prototypical mansard roof with the distinctive dormers with the wood detailing, the patterned shingles, and the tall brick chimneys.
Historical and Associative Value
The cultural heritage value of the property at 133 John Street is related to the renowned Canadian athlete and local politician, Edward (Ned) Hanlan (1855-1908) who resided at this location with his family in 1883-1893 and maintained ownership of the property until 1905. A multi-year World Champion sculler for Canada in 1880-1884, Hanlan has been recognized as ""the new nation's first world sporting champion in an individual or singles event"". Following his illustrious rowing career, Hanlan was elected as local alderman for the Toronto Island in 1898 and 1899, advocating for electrification on the island as well safe city bicycle lanes and public swimming pools on the mainland. Hanlan is commemorated by a 1926 bronze statue sculpted by Emmanuel Hahn that currently stands on the ferry docks at the eponymous Hanlan's Point on the Toronto Island and as a National Historic Person since 1938.
The property at 133 John Street is also valued as the location of Toronto&rsquo;s first brewpub in 1985 and the original location of what would become The Amsterdam Brewing Company less than ten years later.&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property at 133 John Street is valued for the role of the residential building in defining, supporting and maintaining the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, reflecting its evolution from a 19th-century residential and institutional enclave and Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing centre in the 20th century, to its current status as a mixed-use community.&nbsp;
As a surviving 19th-century residential building, the detached house at 133 John Street is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and is directly north of the historic row houses (1892) at 109-129 John Street, which are listed on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register, and complements the neighbouring buildings at 118-122 John Street with their similar Second Empire styling.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 906 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value and associative value.
Description
The property at 906 Yonge Street (including the entrance address at 908 Yonge Street) is located on the west side of Yonge Street, north of Davenport Road. The property contains a three-storey commercial building that was designed in the Tudor Revival style by architect D. Mackenzie Waters in 1928 to house Ridpath's Ltd., which manufactured and sold fine furniture out of the premises for over 80 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Dating to 1928, the property 906 Yonge Street has design and physical value as a representative example of the Tudor Revival architectural style that gained popularity in Toronto in the early-20th century. The property retains its original scale, form, and massing as a three-storey building, and its design value as a representative example of the Tudor Revival style is reflected in many of its extant original features, including its steeply-pitched side-gabled and parapeted roof, and decorative east (principal) elevation, which features three front-facing gables with decorative trim, half-timber cladding, three bays of oriel windows at the second and third storeys inset with steel multi-pane and leaded casement units, and a rubble-stone base.
The property at 906 Yonge Street also has design and physical value as a rare commercial application of the Tudor Revival architectural style in Toronto. While this style saw wide application to residential buildings in the early 20th century, few commercial buildings were designed using this architectural language. The application of the Tudor Revival style to the Ridpath showroom at 906 Yonge Street demonstrates the design influence of Liberty's department store in London, UK, and also reveals Ridpath's role providing furnishings for affluent Toronto homes in the early 20th century, many of which would have been designed in a similar architectural style.
The property also has design and physical value for the high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit displayed in a number of its features, most notably on the building's principal (east) elevation along Yonge Street, and the third-floor ""Oak Room"" at its interior. Features that reflect a high degree of craftsmanship include the leaded-glass casement windows at the third storey, and the interior third floor ""Oak Room"", which features artistically carved oak panelling throughout, and an ornately carved wood and stone fireplace at the north wall.&nbsp;
The property at 906 Yonge Street is also valued for its direct association with Ridpath's Ltd., and its founder John I. Ridpath. The property was purpose-built in 1928 to house a showroom and workshop for Ridpath's Ltd., a company that manufactured, repaired, and sold furniture to the people of Toronto for over a century. After moving to Toronto, John Ridpath quickly established himself in the furniture making industry by emphasizing high quality craftsmanship and customer service. A successful businessman, Ridpath founded his own furniture-making business in 1907, but sought to widen his company's influence by expanding into the broader home furnishing industry by including fabrics, objects d'art and interior decorating services in addition to furniture. The company also bolstered its presence in the nascent interior design industry of the 1930s by hosting a variety of art- and design-focussed lectures, events, and exhibitions out of its third-floor ""Oak Room"". In the 1950s, Ridpath's took on several important commissions that further demonstrated the company's prestige, including furnishing the Ontario Hydro Commission's Hydro House exhibit at the C.N.E., and creating the ceremonial chairs for the Queen and other dignitaries (including Vice President of the United States Richard Nixon) who were in the country attending the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Ridpath's operated out of 906 Yonge Street for over eight decades before finally closing its doors in 2011.
The property at 906 Yonge Street is also valued for its association with significant Toronto architect D. Mackenzie Waters, who designed the building in the Tudor Revival style in 1928. Born in Belleville, Ontario, Waters was a decorated war hero and award-winning architect with a career that spanned over three decades. Waters' early work in the 1920s and 1930s drew heavily from his keen awareness of period architecture. While Waters is best known for his grand Georgian Revival homes during this period, his deep knowledge of historical architecture is also evident in several Tudor Revival commissions, including private residences in Toronto and Ottawa, and the Ridpath's showroom at 906 Yonge Street (1928). Beginning in the mid-1930s, Waters was also influential in introducing International Modernism to Canada, and his Deck House at the Elgin House Hotel, Lake Joseph, Muskoka (1938) is now regarded as a landmark of Modernism in Canada.
Waters was also important in developing and promoting the architectural profession in Canada during the interwar period, and was a member of the ""Diet Kitchen"", a group of seven young local architects that sought to promote the work of Canadian architects. Due to his interest in historical architecture, Waters also became a prominent early voice for local conservation efforts; he helped found the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario (ACO) in 1933, and was involved in the efforts to restore Fort York the following year. Beginning in the 1930s, Waters also taught architectural design at the University of Toronto alongside another well-known local architect and founding member of the ACO, Eric Arthur.

Reasons for Designation
The property at 1909 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, associative value, and contextual value.
Description
The property at 1909 Yonge Street (including the entrance addresses at 2 and 2A Davisville Avenue) is located in the historic community of Davisville/North Toronto, where it anchors the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue. The property contains the J. J. Davis General store, a 2-storey late-Victorian vernacular mixed-use building with frontages on both Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue, which was constructed circa 1890 and was owned and occupied by members of the Davis family of Davisville from 1896 to 1945.
Surrounding properties recognized on the Heritage Register include a row of early-20th-century main street commercial buildings immediately to the north at 1913, 1917, 1919, 1919A, 1921 and 1923 Yonge Street.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Dating to circa 1890, the property at 1909 Yonge Street is a representative example of a late-Victorian vernacular mixed-use building typology. It retains its scale, form, and massing as a two-storey brick building with a cross-gable roof, and original window openings at the upper storey. The building's ground storey has been significantly altered over time to accommodate commercial uses.
The property at 1909 Yonge Street has historical value as a rare surviving mixed-use building on Yonge Street from the late 19th century. The property is also valued for its associations with the historical evolution of the Davisville neighbourhood, for which it served the important role of post office and general store in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. The property has further historical value for its associations with the Davis family of Davisville, in particular postmaster and grocer J. J. Davis and his two brothers Charles R. and Herbert B. Davis, who owned the property from 1896 to 1945 and operated it as a post office and store for nearly 50 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Located at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue, and reflecting a late-19th-century scale and architectural form, the mixed-use building at 1909 Yonge Street has contextual value for its contribution to the historic character of the east side of Yonge Street, between Davisville Avenue and Millwood Road, which features a grouping of late-19th- and early-20th-century buildings.
As one of the oldest mixed-use buildings in the surrounding area, the property at 1909 Yonge Street also has contextual value for its visual and historical links to its surroundings. Located at the corner of Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue, one of the earliest east-west streets in the area, the building reflects the first wave of development in Davisville, and is a remnant of the fine-grained mixed-use streetscape that existed along Yonge Street in the 19th century.
Anchoring the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue, and featuring a rare early architectural form along Yonge Street in North Toronto, the property at 1909 Yonge Street may also be considered a local landmark within Davisville.

JOSEPH STREET",2022-03-15 04:00:00,"TAKE NOTICE that Council for the City of Toronto intends to designate the property, including the lands, buildings and structures thereon known municipally as 95 St. Joseph Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.O.18, as amended, as a property of cultural heritage value or interest.
Reasons for Designation
The property at 95 St. Joseph Street (St. Basil's Seminary) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value
Description
The property at 95 St. Joseph Street is located on the south side of St. Joseph Street, west of Bay Street on the University of St. Michael's College campus in the Bay Cloverhill neighbourhood.&nbsp; The property contains a buff-brick clad, four-storey seminary built for the education of priests in the Basilian order and commissioned by St. Michael's College.&nbsp; Designed by Ernest Cormier, OC, with local architects Brennan &amp; Whale, it was constructed on an E-shaped plan with a chapel in the centre leg and completed between 1950 and 1951. The east wing of the seminary was extended by Brennan &amp; Whale in 1959.&nbsp; In 1979-80, a concrete-clad extension supported on concrete piers was added to the fourth floor on the principal, north elevation as part of the adaptation of the seminary as a retirement residence for the Basilian Fathers.&nbsp; It is now known as the Cardinal Flahiff Basilian Centre, named for George Bernard Cardinal Flahiff (1909-1989) a St. Michael's student and seminarian, Archbishop of Winnipeg, and later Cardinal, who retired there in 1982.
The property also contains a chapel, designed by Arthur W. Holmes in 1913 as part of Newman Hall, a social centre for Roman Catholic university students attending St. Michael's College. With the relocation of Newman Hall to the west side of the University of Toronto campus in 1922, the building ceased to function as a chapel from 1928-1949.&nbsp; Cormier's design for the seminary included the chapel with the intention of it having a recreational use.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value - St. Basil's Seminary
Constructed in 1950-51, with two extensions in 1959 and 1979-80, St. Basil's Seminary is an excellent example of Post-World War II ecclesiastical architecture as it combines formal elements of Modernism and traditional architecture appropriate to its function as a seminary, which as a building type is rooted in historic Christian tradition.&nbsp; The concept and form of the four-storey building places the primary functions of the community, the chapel and the dining room, at the heart of the E-shaped complex and on axis with the principal entrance. This arrangement expresses the symbolic importance of these spaces, while functionally it permits daylight to illuminate the stained and leaded glass windows of the chapel from the south, east and west sides and, from the dining room, enables residents views and access to the landscaped courtyards.&nbsp;
Stylistically, the selected materials of buff brick and stone link the building with the historic context of the 1856 St. Basil's Church and original St. Michael's College emphasizing the history and tradition of the college campus.&nbsp; The stone door surround with its pediment (now removed), arch, piers and tympanum set at the top of a grand dual stone staircase is a traditional element suitable to express the Basilian Fathers' history and tradition as the tympanum contains their crest and motto ""Doce Me Bonitatem, et Disciplinum et Scientiam"" (""Teach Me Goodness, Discipline and Wisdom""). The use of stone string courses at the second and fourth floor windows indicates a traditional concept of the palazzo type with a base, grand upper stories and attic storey.&nbsp; The building balances these traditional aspects with modern elements such as the flat roof, the minimal ornamentation and simplicity of the facades which rely on carefully proportioned grids of windows for effect. In the composition outlined above, as well as in the use of panels of stacked brick and the truncation of the stone string courses to emphasize the corners, a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit is revealed in the design of the elevations.
The interior spaces of the cruciform entrance lobby and the chapel are highly-designed examples of a Post-World War II institutional building expressing a cohesive integration of both traditional and modern stylistic elements.&nbsp; The lobby emphasizes the intersection of two significant axis of the building's functions, the communal place of religious worship and the more secular aspects of seminary living.&nbsp; This is marked in the cruciform plan of the lobby, the four columns with their simplified modern treatment and in the terrazzo floor.&nbsp; In the chapel, the traditional elements are present in the form of the space as a lofty rectangular volume, with stained and leaded glass windows along the side walls, the south end with the sacristy, and at the north end with the organ loft and gallery. The pointed arched window openings of the Gothic are here represented with simple triangular heads. The windows, apart from three stained glass windows on the south wall with their representations of saints, are of leaded glass with modernist grids incorporating narrow strips of red glass.&nbsp; Instead of stone, the interior walls are constructed of concrete block in grey with bands and borders of narrower, chisel-faced, tinted red blocks with red-coloured mortar.&nbsp; Further modernist elements are provided by the patterned terrazzo floors.&nbsp; In its design and details, the chapel represents a high level of artistic merit and craftsmanship. The chapel, according to Phyllis Lambert, CC, and Founding Director Emeritus of the Centre for Canadian Architecture is of the ""highest quality.""[1]
The property at 95 St. Joseph Street has historical and associative value as it is related to the religious organization of the Basilian Fathers who originated in France in 1828 and were established in Toronto in 1850 with the arrival of Armand-Francois-Marie Charbonnel, the newly appointed Archbishop of Toronto. The Basilians established St. Michael's College in 1852 as a high school, college and seminary and in 1856 relocated to the Clover Hill Estate where they constructed St. Basil's, a parish church and Odette Hall to accommodate the college.&nbsp; This 19th-century building complex continues today as the nucleus of the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto.
In the late 1940s, as their centenary approached, the Basilians sought to separate the original three functions into distinct entities and commissioned Ernest Cormier to design a new high school, St. Michael's College at 1515 Bathurst Street, a new college building, Carr Hall and seminary.&nbsp; The seminary, now known as the Cardinal Flahiff Basilian Centre at 95 St. Joseph Street is a significant outcome of this event and an indication of the growth and expansion of the institution.&nbsp; From their origins in Toronto the Basilian Fathers have expanded their teaching and parish work across Canada and North America as well as Mexico and Colombia.&nbsp;
George Bernard Cardinal Flahiff (1909-1989), for whom the centre is currently named, was an outstanding Basilian leader, educated at St. Michael's College high school, college and seminary, and appointed the Archbishop of Winnipeg from 1961-1982 and elevated to Cardinal in 1969. His significance lies in his participation on the Second Vatican Council from 1962-1965 and in the 1978 Conclaves that elected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II. On his retirement in 1982, Cardinal Flahiff returned to live at St. Basil's Seminary until his death. The seminary was renamed Cardinal Flahiff Basilian Centre in his honour.
In its design, including its massing, functional arrangement, materials and details, the Roman Catholic St. Basil's Seminary yields information that contributes to an understanding of the way of life of a religious community.
The design for St. Basil's Seminary clearly demonstrates the work of the architect and engineer Ernest Cormier and is considered to be a ""prime example of Cormier's ecclesiastical architecture""[2] Ernest Cormier (1885-1980) trained as an engineer at the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal and in Paris, and as an architect at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, and the British School in Rome.&nbsp; He also apprenticed as an interior designer and was skilled at both furniture design and interior design as well as watercolours, sculpture, photography and bookbinding.&nbsp; His career is distinguished by important public buildings including the University of Montreal (1924-1949), the Supreme Court of Canada (1938-39), the Grand Seminaire de Quebec City, (1940-72) and National Printing Bureau in Hull, (1950-58).&nbsp; He was renowned as an engineer and is credited with introducing technical advances in concrete construction with his bridge at La Chute, Quebec, completed shortly after his return to Canada in 1918 and at the 1928 Hydroplane Hangar at Pointe-aux-Trembles where he constructed the first reinforced concrete arched hangar in North America. The synthesis of his range of talents is evident in his own house and garden at the Avenue des Pins in Montreal (1930-31) which is considered to be the finest example of Art Deco domestic architecture in North America. Declared to be the ""great Canadian architect of the twentieth century,""[3] The pinnacle of recognition came with his selection as the Canadian representative for the re-design of the permanent headquarters for the United Nations, New York in 1947 where he contributed to the design of the General Assembly Building and was the sole designer for the pair of bronze doors with relief sculptures.&nbsp; Winner of multiple awards throughout his lifetime, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1974.&nbsp;
Constructed in 1950-51, St. Basil's Seminary is important in defining, maintaining and supporting the character of St. Michael's College campus.&nbsp; It's low-rise, four-storey volume, set-back from the street with a lawn and grand staircase corresponds in height, scale and materials with the other college buildings.&nbsp; Its scale, massing and materials of buff brick and stone, and the detailing of its stone entrance link it to the original St. Michael's College complex of 1856 which included St. Basil's Church and the buff brick relates to Sam Sorbara Hall (2001) immediately to the north.&nbsp; Its modern form with a flat roof and grids of windows relates to other Post-World War II modernist buildings including the adjacent John M. Kelly library (1960-70), Carr Hall (1950-54) and Elmsley Hall (1955).&nbsp; Its height and set back from the street corresponds to the low-rise height and set back of the John M. Kelly Library, the Muzzo Family Alumnae Hall, formerly the Ontario Research Foundation (1930, 1946), and the Toronto School of Theology on the south side of St. Joseph Street, to the west, which provide a consistent scale, street wall and landscaped open space along St. Joseph Street. On the north side of the street, the low-rise scale and set-backs contribute to the consistency of place, while the red-brick house-form properties of Elmsley Place, retain the scale and landscaped setbacks, while the variety of types, styles and materials tells the 160-year history of the college campus.
St. Basil's Seminary is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings. With its yellow brick cladding and traditional stone entry, it is visually linked to the original 1856 college which has the same materials.&nbsp; Located on the south side of St. Joseph Street at the south-east corner of the St. Michael's College campus and built in 1951-50, the seminary building was commissioned as an extension to the original 1856 St. Michael's College and was part of the separation of the three original functions of high school, college and seminary into three separate buildings to celebrate the centenary of the college.&nbsp; St. Basil's Seminary with Carr Hall, located on the north side and west end of St. Joseph Street, the John M. Kelly Library adjacent on the south side of the street, represent the post-World War II additions to the college campus which in their form, scale and massing and set back provide a continuity with the traditional campus, while their architectural style represents a second century of the University of St. Michael's College.&nbsp;

Design and Physical Value
The following heritage attributes contribute to the design and physical value of the
St. Basil's Seminary at 95 St. Joseph Street as an excellent representative of Post-World War II ecclesiastical architecture, and as a representative of Cormier's style, as it combines formal elements of Modernism and traditional architecture appropriate to its function as a seminary, which as a building type is rooted in historic Christian tradition:

Please Note: the 1979-1980 fourth floor extension is not included in the heritage attributes.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value - Newman Hall Chapel
Constructed in 1913, the former Newman Hall Chapel is representative of the chapel typology in its form and massing which is a single-storey volume with a steeply-pitched gable roof, a projecting entry bay on its principal north fa&ccedil;ade with a large round-headed opening, wide enough for double doors and originally a glazed transom above.&nbsp; Other details including the three arched windows of varying height in the gable of the principle elevation and the buttress-like piers along it east and west side walls are characteristics of the typology.&nbsp; Stylistically, its steeply-pitched gable roofed form, combined with the semi-circular head of the door opening with its staggered stone quoins and with its arched richly moulded drip mould represents a medieval style incorporating both Gothic and Norman influences.&nbsp; Originally clad in a buff brick with stone trim which correspond to St. Basil's Church and Odette Hall, the chapel has been over-clad with a stucco material on its east, south and west elevations.&nbsp; Buff brick and stone are still evident on its north elevation.
The former chapel has historical and associative value as it is related to the religious organization of the Basilian Fathers who originated in France in 1828 and were established in Toronto in 1850 with the arrival of Armand-Francois-Marie Charbonnel, the newly appointed Archbishop of Toronto. The Basilians established St. Michael's College in 1852 as a high school, college and seminary and in 1856 relocated to the Clover Hill Estate where they constructed St. Basil's, a parish church and Odette Hall to accommodate the college.&nbsp; This 19th-century building complex continues today as the nucleus of the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto.
In 1913, the chapel was built as part of the creation of the Newman Hall by Bishop Neil McNeil as a social club for Catholic university students attending St. Michael's College.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Newman Chapel was built in the garden behind the existing house at 97 St. Joseph Street.&nbsp; While the house was demolished when the new St. Joseph Seminary was constructed in 1950-51, the chapel which had been used as an automobile refinishing premises from 1928, was integrated into the new seminary design and proposed for use as a gymnasium. Apart from the period in the 1920s-1940s, the chapel has been part of the St. Michael's College community and that of St. Basil's Seminary for over a century and represents the early origins and expansion of the college.
The chapel has potential to yield information that contributes to an understanding of a community or culture as it represents the early history of the Newman Centre which was created as a social club for Catholic students at St. Michael's College.&nbsp; The provision of a chapel in proximity to the club indicates the importance of daily and shared religious worship to the community of students at that time.
The chapel reflects the work of the architect who is significant to the Catholic community. Arthur W. Holmes, (1863-1944) the architect who designed the chapel at Newman Hall, was a prolific architect, known for his ecclesiastical commissions for the Roman Catholic Church, of which the most prominent is the design for St. Augustine's Seminary 1910-1913.&nbsp; The Newman Hall chapel was one of several commission Holmes undertook for St. Michaels College including a new spire and steeple for St. Basil's Church, 1895, the extension of the east wing of Odette Hall, 1902-3 and following the final Elmsley bequest to the college in 1921, the masterplan for the college and the design of Teefy Hall and the Pontifical Institute for Medieval Studies, 1935-6, Brennan Hall, 1938 and refectory, 1938.&nbsp; These buildings designed in a stripped down Collegiate Gothic style with their Credit Valley limestone cladding with its distinctive textures and patterning determined the developing character of the college in terms of its built form and materials but also in the sequence of landscaped public open spaces and pathways.&nbsp; Under his guidance, the college extended its presence by contributing to the ring of university buildings that faced onto Queen's Park Crescent, reinforced the axis of Elmsley Place, and with Brennan Hall provided a meaningful link between the historic college core of St. Basil's Church and Odette Hall to the east and the new complex and connection to the rest of the university in the west.
Although not visible from St. Joseph Street, the chapel is located in the west courtyard of the seminary building and contributes to defining and supporting the character of the property and its early association with Newman Hall and the early 20th century history of St. Michael's College and the community of Catholic students.&nbsp;
Constructed in 1913, the chapel has been physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to the surroundings of the St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto and later the St. Basil's Seminary, first as a place of worship and later as a gymnasium for the seminary.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
&nbsp;The property at 778 King Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, historical/associative value, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description of the Property
&nbsp;
Designed by Leo Hunt Stanford, the property at 778 King Street West was constructed in 1947 as the headquarters of the York Mending Wool Company. It was subsequently the location of Uniforms Registered and the notable Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation gallery, and is currently a real estate office. The property is located on the north side of King Street West, just west of Tecumseth Street. A two-storey form with a flat roof, the building is faced in red-orange brick with stone trim.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 778 King Street West is a representative example of a mid-twentieth-century industrial headquarters, demonstrating the influence of the Streamlined Moderne style in its material palette, detailing, and horizontal emphasis. The building retains its red-orange brick exterior, tiered brick pilasters above a stone-clad entry, stone detailing such as belt courses and geometric motifs, and horizontal rhythm of fenestration on the primary (south) elevation, despite the lowering of the ground-floor window openings, as well as intact architectural details on the east elevation such as glass block panels.
&nbsp;
Constructed for the York Mending Wool Company in 1947, the subject property has direct associations with the redevelopment of King Street West for manufacturing during the first half of the twentieth century. The property was one of a number of industrial buildings in the immediate vicinity on King Street West that represented textile-related industries. The property also reflects the later period of cultural regeneration along King Street West, and has associative value as the location of the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation Gallery from 1988 to 2012. After artist and curator Ydessa Hendeles hired architect Peter Smith to renovate the building, she operated a celebrated non-profit centre for exhibiting international contemporary art in Canada. A large extant skylight, running horizontally across the building's centre, was added by Smith in 1988 as part of the property's successful adaptive reuse.
&nbsp;
For over 70 years, the former York Mending Wool Company building, later Uniforms Registered and the notable Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation gallery, has been physically, functionally, and historically linked to its surrounding context, initially as a contributor to King Street West for manufacturing during the first half of the twentieth century, as well as to the area's later period of adaptive reuse and cultural regeneration.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 14 Duncan Street (including entrance addresses at 180, 184, and 188 Pearl Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design and physical, historical and associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 14 Duncan Street is located on the northwest corner of Duncan and Pearl streets in the King-Spadina neighbourhood. It contains the Telfer Paper Box Building, a three-storey structure on a raised basement that was constructed in 1902 by the Telfer Manufacturing Company according to the designs of the well-known Toronto architects Gregg and Gregg. The property is fashioned in the Edwardian Classical style. Occupied for 60 years by the Telfer Paper Box Company, the facility was expanded in 1906 by Wickson and Gregg and again in 1925, when a westward extension was added as was a fourth-storey to this wing. The property was modified at the end of the 20th century when it was converted for commercial uses.
&nbsp;
The property at 14 Duncan Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on March 9, 2017 and was identified as a contributing property within the proposed King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2017 and currently under appeal.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The Telfer Paper Box Building is valued for its design and physical value as a representative example of an early, 20th-century factory building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood with Edwardian Classical detailing. The three-storey scale above a raised basement, rectangular form and massing, brick cladding, and flat roofline are characteristic of this building type. The Edwardian Classical style is the most popular style for a range of architectural types in the pre-World War I era, including industrial edifices. Elements of the style are seen in the principal (east) elevation in the symmetrical arrangement of the openings beneath the round-arched arcades with keystones, the segmental-arched openings in the first-storey, and in the side (south) elevation in one-bay round-arched arcade (the window openings have been enlarged) and the flat-headed openings with cast stone sills. The style can further be seen in the side (south) elevation of the 1906 westward addition in the symmetrical arrangement of the openings beneath the round-arched arcades, the round-arched window opening in the third-storey, the segmental-arched openings in the first- and second-storeys, and the cast stone sills in the second- and third-storeys. The style is also carried through to the side (north) elevation, which is viewed from Duncan Street, and displays flat-headed and a round-arched arcade. Following its conversion for commercial uses, the building was updated with the oversized cornice and vertical entrance bays in the principal (east) and side (south) elevations identified with late 20th-century Post-Modernism.
&nbsp;
Historical or Associative Value
The property at 14 Duncan Street is valued for its association with the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg, which received the commission prior to the dissolution of the partnership. While W. R. (William Rufus) Gregg and his younger brother, A. H. (Alfred Holden) Gregg practiced alone and with other partners during their careers, for the period between 1893 and 1904 when they worked together, the pair is credited with several factories in the King-Spadina neighbourhood. This includes surviving examples near the intersection of King and Pearl streets where the subject property is found. Gregg, in partnership with A. Frank Wickson, completed the complementary west wing (1906) of the Telfer Paper Box Building.
&nbsp;
The cultural heritage value of the property at 14 Duncan Street is also through its contribution to the development, evolution and regeneration of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the 20th century. When the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904, the Telfer Paper Box Building was one of the first structures completed on the former Upper Canada College lands after the campus was redeveloped for industrial uses. Beginning in the post-World War II era, King-Spadina declined with the relocation of many industries to Toronto's suburbs. The restoration of the Royal Alexandra Theatre by entrepreneur Edwin ""Honest Ed"" Mirvish in the 1960s and his conversion of the neighbouring early-20th century warehouses to restaurants began the revival of the area. In the 1980s, the property at 14 Duncan was converted from industrial to commercial uses as part of the ongoing regeneration of King-Spadina.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
With its three-storey scale above a raised basement, rectangular form and massing, red brick cladding with brick, stone and wood detailing, and flat roofline, the value of the property at 14 Duncan Street is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it is part of an important collection of former factories and warehouses that were constructed in the early-20th century in similar architectural styles that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto's new manufacturing centre following the Great Fire of 1904. Through its placement, setback, and orientation at the northwest corner of Duncan and Pearl streets, the Telfer Paper Box Company Building is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its setting where, with the heritage properties containing the Canada Printing Ink Building (1903) at 15 Duncan Street, the White Swan Mills Building (1903) at 156 and 158 Pearl Street, and the Southam Press Building (1908) at 19 Duncan Street, it contributes to the enclave of industrial buildings on and adjoining Duncan Street, north of King Street West.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 1420 Yonge Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical, historical/associative, and contextual values.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description
The property at 1420 Yonge Street (built 1932) comprises a row of four, 2-storey main street commercial buildings with storefronts to support retail uses at grade and residential above which are located along the west side of Yonge Street south of St. Clair Avenue between Pleasant Boulevard and Rosehill Avenue. This block and the adjacent subject property are separated by a driveway entry owned by St. Michael's Cemetery, located to the immediate west (rear), which provides a historic sightline into the cemetery from Yonge Street. The position and framing of the subject properties at 1418 and 1406 Yonge Street on either side of the driveway provide a historic sightline to the site of St. Michael's Cemetery Mortuary Vault (built 1856), designed by architect Joseph Sheard, which was designated in 1975 under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The row of four properties at 1420 Yonge Street is valued as a fine example of early 20th-century main street commercial row typology. Designed by Benjamin Swartz with a blend of Art Deco and Art Nouveau influences, the principal (east) elevation includes stone surrounds framing the ground-level retail bays, side entrances, and upper-storey windows, stone banding below and capping the segmented parapet roofline, and seven stone spandrel panels with stylized, hand-carved, floral motifs. Original drawings by Swartz reveal the principal (east) elevation to retain its architectural integrity.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 1420 Yonge Street has direct associations with the Cira family, whose 1930 commissioning of the property and subsequent 90-year ownership, signal a significant history and cultural legacy within the Deer Park community. Part of the neighbourhood's transformation from a rural outpost to a bustling streetcar suburb and commercial and transit hub, the Cira family's construction of the main street commercial row at 1420 Yonge Street was part of the family's larger real estate and commercial empire within the area. Predated by the Cira's Swartz-designed pair of 4-storey apartment blocks at 923 and 925 St. Clair Avenue West built in 1928, and the 1929 establishment of what became the Cira Bros. Grocers property at 1491-1493 Yonge Street, the subject property at 1420 Yonge Street survives as a significant piece not only of Deer Park's built heritage, but of an immigrant family's success story and nearly century-long legacy in the midtown Toronto area.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 1420 Yonge Street has a direct association with the history of the adjacent St. Michael's Cemetery, the former lands upon which the subject row of main street commercial properties were constructed in 1932. This block, along with the adjacent subject property at 1390-1406 Yonge Street, is historically linked to St. Michael's Cemetery and to the broader commercial development of the area.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Lastly, 1420 Yonge Street reflects the work of Toronto-based architect Benjamin Swartz (1899-1961), an architect of note within the Jewish community who also designed the Kiever Synagogue (1923) in Kensington Market.&nbsp; Expressed elsewhere within his body of work, Swartz' signature blending of Art Nouveau and Art Deco influences and materiality are clearly expressed upon the principal (east) elevation of 1420 Yonge Street. The property's distinctive details, including the stone surrounds framing the entryways and window openings, stone banding, and stone-capped, parapet roofline embellished with decorative stone spandrel panels, tie this work to others by Swartz, including the 1928-built apartment blocks at 923 and 925 St. Clair Avenue West he also designed for the Cira family just two years prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, 1420 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the historic character of this portion of Yonge Street. Situated along the west side of Yonge Street south of St. Clair Avenue between Pleasant Boulevard and Rosehill Avenue, the property is an important contributor to the maintenance of the early 20th-century main street commercial built form evolution and historic character of the area, along with the adjacent main street commercial row at 1390-1406 Yonge Street.
&nbsp;
The main street commercial rows at 1420 and 1390-1406 Yonge Street are contextually linked by their physical and visual relationship to St. Michael's Cemetery. The historic relationship between the cemetery and the two commercial rows is enhanced by the historic sightline/view of St. Michael's Cemetery provided by the driveway entry between 1418 and 1406 Yonge Street. This historic sightline from Yonge Street, which has existed for over 165 years, allows for an unobstructed view of St. Michael's Cemetery Mortuary Vault (built 1856), designed by architect Joseph Sheard, which was designated in 1975 under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 68 Kendal Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 68 Kendal Avenue contains the Audley Court Apartments, located on the west side of Kendal Avenue, north of Bernard Avenue. Constructed by Charles R. S. Dinnick in 1912 to the designs of the architect Joseph Hunt Stanford, the red-brick building is a fine example of Edwardian Classicism.&nbsp; It follows a design precedent set by the Spadina Gardens Apartments, located at 41 Spadina Road, for early apartment block design, and it has not undergone any significant renovations since construction, retaining its original scale, form, and massing as a three-and-half-story apartment building. The property was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1983 and is included within the boundary of the West Annex Phase 2 study area authorized by City Council in 2018.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Originally constructed in 1912, the property at 68 Kendal Avenue, known as the Audley Court Apartments has cultural heritage value as a representative example of the apartment building typology that emerged in Canada in the early-20th century following precedents from Europe and the United States. The building is a surviving example of one the few purpose-built rental properties in the Annex dating to the neighbourhood's primary period of development between 1905 and 1912. It retains its original form and construction, with only minor variations from the initial permit drawings.
Audley Court Apartments has further design and physical value as a fine example of Edwardian Classicism, an architectural style that came to define apartment buildings from this era of apartment building. The style is represented in many of its extant original features including the symmetrical design of the plans and elevations, featuring bay windows on the primary and side elevations, balconies supported by Tuscan Doric columns, the classical details surrounding the principal entrance, the central pair of bulls-eye windows on the upper floor, and the prominent cornice with its decorative bands and dentil course. A high degree of craftsmanship is evident in its materiality and architectural execution, including the finely turned wood columns, carved balustrades, and detailing around the entrance. The property retains its original scale, form, and massing as a 3-1/2-storey apartment building with no significant alterations to the exterior since its date of construction over a century ago.
&nbsp;
The property has historical and associative value related to its builder, C. R. S. Dinnick (1846-1931). He was a prolific contractor, president of a brick manufacturing company, and land developer who built high quality brick housing for Toronto's middle- and upper-classes. Dinnick specialised in purchasing several lots of land on a street at one time, building homes on them, and offering them for sale or rent. He would move into one of the first houses constructed, and live there while completing construction on the other properties, before moving on to his next opportunity. Dinnick also established himself as a builder on a city-wide scale, and was awarded the contract to build one of the newly designed Gouinlock buildings for the CNE in 1906.
&nbsp;
The Audley Court Apartments also has historical value for its association with Joseph Hunt Stanford (1871-1935), a notable Toronto architect who designed both residential and commercial buildings. Stanford trained and worked in England for a number of years before immigrating to Canada in 1902.&nbsp; He began his own practice in Toronto in 1904, and was one of the earliest local architects to design multi-unit apartment blocks. He helped promote the use of Edwardian Classicism as the predominant style for early apartment form housing, and masterfully employed the style in many of his buildings that survive to present day, including The Audley Court Apartments and the St Charles Court Apartments (designated Part IV in 1991). The building at 68 Kendal Avenue was completed shortly before Stanford went to serve in the First World War.
&nbsp;
The property has historic value for its associations to the Therafields organization, which was active in the 1960s-1970s and offered a new approach to psychotherapy. The organization acquired numerous properties in the Annex neighbourhood, and used many of them to host 'house groups', where members of the commune lived together in an immersive group therapy environment. The other properties, including 68 Kendal Avenue, provided more typical rental housing to members that were not part of house groups. Therafields actively sought to assemble blocks of adjoining properties to create a stronger community experience, and 68 Kendal Avenue was contiguous to 6 other Therafields-owned buildings, some of which did operate as house groups. Regardless of type, all residents were expected to contribute to the physical maintenance and upkeep of the buildings.
Located on the west side of Kendal Avenue, the low-rise apartment building at 68 Kendal Avenue has contextual value for its contribution to the character of the west Annex, which is typified by early-20th century detached housing in the Annex and Edwardian Classicism styles. It maintains the same setbacks and materiality as the neighbouring properties, and is harmoniously integrated into the mid-block streetscape. Although 68 Kendal was one of the last properties to be constructed in the neighbourhood, it represents the culmination of the concentrated period of development that occurred in this part of The Annex between 1905 and 1912.
&nbsp;
As part of the growth and development of the west Annex as a residential enclave in the early years of the 20th century, the property is physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp; It has value as an example of the small-scale apartment type which was emerging around the city and in the Annex at this time, including nearby examples on Spadina and Madison avenues. The apartment building at 68 Kendal Avenue is also contextually valued for its historical and visual links to the neighbouring property at 72 Kendal Avenue, the personal residence of C. R. S. Dinnick, the subdivision's developer. Dinnick acted as the landlord for the Audley Court Apartments from the date of its completion until his death in the early 1931.
&nbsp;
68 Kendal is regarded by many Annex residents as a neighbourhood landmark for its finely detailed architecture, well-kept appearance, and lauded example of the 'missing middle' typology.

&nbsp;
This notice is being served to the Owner of the Property, the Ontario Heritage Trust, and any Objectors and Interested Persons.
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 2726 Danforth Avenue, now known as the Little York Hotel, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the north side of Danforth Avenue just west of Dawes Road in the heart of the former village of Little York, the pre-confederation era building at 2726 Danforth Avenue is the only surviving example of the 19th-century hotel/inn-type buildings that defined this historic intersection into the early 20th century.
&nbsp;
The property was identified in the Danforth Avenue Planning Study - Coxwell Avenue to Victoria Park Avenue (2018) and Main Street Planning Study (2019) as a potential heritage property and was subsequently listed on the City's Heritage Register on December 16, 2020.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property at 2726 Danforth Avenue is valued as a unique surviving example in the historic Village of Little York of a pre-confederation era building. Built c.1850s-1860s, the former hotel/inn is representative of a typology which once occupied numerous properties around the Danforth Avenue and Dawes Road intersection in the mid-19th century.
&nbsp;
Georgian styling is evident in the five nearly symmetrically-arranged, flat-headed window openings on the upper level with their double-hung sash wooden frames and two-over-two panes. Of particular significance is the building's timber-frame construction which includes massive 12""x12"" oak posts and beams. Significantly, these structural members and their joinery were hand-hewn &ndash; a quality and level of craftsmanship that belies a construction date preceding the advent of machined lumber. Exterior sheathing on the upper-storey timber-frame structure consists of original lath and plaster behind tongue-and-groove wood siding. The single-storey retail storefront addition is an early 20th-century alteration to the original building and reflects the then emerging main street commercial character of Danforth Avenue.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The subject property is valued for its ability to yield information that contributes to our understanding of the development of various historic settlements near the GTR tracks at the corner of Danforth Avenue and Dawes Road from the mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth centuries. First the location of Dawes' Corners in 1850, followed by Smith's Corner in 1870, and Little York and Coleman's Corner from the 1880s until the annexation of Little York to the Town of East Toronto in 1903, this intersection was a popular location for local inns and stores to serve the residential and commercial needs of market-bound farmers along Dawes Road, as well as a burgeoning local population.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the Little York Hotel is visually, physically and historically linked to the Danforth and Dawes intersection where this pre-confederation era building represents the only remaining built evidence of numerous 19th-century hotels/inns once standing at this location.
&nbsp;
The building is valued for single-handedly maintaining this once-defining typology in the area and, along with the adjacent main street commercial row properties at 2734-2740 Danforth Avenue, supporting the mid-late 19th century character as a stopping point for travellers and farmers between the rural northeast and downtown Toronto.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 1390-1406 Yonge Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical, associative/historical, and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
The properties at 1390-1406 Yonge Street (built 1932) comprise a row of six, 3-storey main street commercial buildings with storefronts to support retail uses at grade and residential above which stand along the west side of Yonge Street south of St. Clair Avenue between Pleasant Boulevard and Rosehill Avenue. This block and the adjacent subject property are separated by a driveway entry owned by St. Michael's Cemetery, located to the immediate west (rear), which provides a historic sightline into the cemetery from Yonge Street. The position and framing of the two subject properties at 1406 and 1418 Yonge Street on either side of the driveway provide a historic sightline to the site of St. Michael's Cemetery Mortuary Vault (built 1856), designed by architect Joseph Sheard, which was designated in 1975 under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The properties at 1390-1406 Yonge Street comprise a fine, representative example of early 20th-century main street commercial row typology. Designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the numerous extant original details include the original and highly intact terracotta roof (with decorative chimneys and wooden brackets supports) and dichromatic, yellow- and rug-brick masonry wall with its raised brick pilasters, banding, and quoining details. The fine-grain composition of the row with commercial at grade and residential above has not been altered since its construction in 1932.
&nbsp;
The Spanish Colonial Revival main street commercial row at 1390-1406 Yonge Street is representative of a broader collection of a particular main street commercial row architecture that appeared along Toronto's main streets and thoroughfares in the early 20th century, including extant examples in the nearby neighbourhoods of Summerhill, Yorkville, and the Annex.
&nbsp;
Associative and Historical Value
The properties at 1390-1406 Yonge Street have a direct association with the history of the adjacent St. Michael's Cemetery, the former lands upon which the subject row of main street commercial properties were constructed in 1932. This block, along with the adjacent subject property at 1420 Yonge Street, is historically linked to St. Michael's Cemetery and to the broader commercial development of the area.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, 1390-1406 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the historic character of this portion of Yonge Street. Situated along the west side of Yonge Street south of St. Clair Avenue between Pleasant Boulevard and Rosehill Avenue, the property is an important contributor to the maintenance of the early 20th-century main street commercial built form evolution and historic character of the area, along with the adjacent main street commercial row at 1420 Yonge Street.
&nbsp;
The main street commercial rows at 1390-1406 and 1420 Yonge Street are contextually linked by their physical and visual relationship to St. Michael's Cemetery. The historic relationship between the cemetery and the two commercial rows is enhanced by the historic sightline/view of St. Michael's Cemetery provided by the driveway entry between 1406 and 1418 Yonge Street. This historic sightline from Yonge Street, which has existed for over 165 years, allows for an unobstructed view of St. Michael's Cemetery Mortuary Vault (built 1856), designed by architect Joseph Sheard, which was designated in 1975 under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 2734 Danforth Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the north side of Danforth Avenue just west of Dawes Road in the heart of the former village of Little York, the late 19th-century main street commercial row property at 2734 Danforth Avenue was built together with the two adjacent properties at 2736 and 2740 Danforth Avenue.
&nbsp;
The property was identified in the Danforth Avenue Planning Study - Coxwell Avenue to Victoria Park Avenue (2018) and Main Street Planning Study (2019) as a potential heritage property and was subsequently listed on the City's Heritage Register on December 16, 2020.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The property at 2734 Danforth Avenue is a significant representative example of the late-19th century main street commercial row typology. Built c. 1886, the 2-storey brick-clad building displays decorative original architectural detailing including a deep wooden cornice with ornate large corner bracket and upper-storey window openings framed with heavy stone lintels affixed with yoke-patterned wooden plates.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The subject property is valued for its ability to yield information that contributes to our understanding of the development of various historic settlements near the GTR tracks at the corner of Danforth Avenue and Dawes Road from the mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth centuries. First the location of Dawes' Corners in 1850, followed by Smith's Corner in 1870, and Little York and Coleman's Corner from the 1880s until the annexation of Little York to the Town of East Toronto in 1903, this intersection was a popular location for local inns and stores to serve the residential and commercial needs of market-bound farmers along Dawes Road, as well as a burgeoning local population.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the late-19th century main street commercial built form evolution and historic character of the Danforth and Dawes intersection in particular, and Danforth Avenue in general.
&nbsp;
Contextually, the property at 2734 Danforth Avenue (along with the rest of the row constructed together at 2736-2740) is visually, physically and historically linked to its surroundings as part of a surviving collection of fine-grained, mixed-use main street commercial and residential row buildings that have developed from discreet pockets clustered around individual rural villages like Little York, to defining the Danforth streetscape.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 221 Sterling Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, historical/associative value, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 221 Sterling Road comprises a complex of adjoining one- and two-storey brick structures, constructed incrementally in c.1914-1918, c.1924-1939, and c.1954-1965. Located on the east side of Sterling Road, the property is set back at an angle from the street, oriented instead in parallel with the railway tracks to the east. The complex runs generally north-south on an irregularly shaped lot, which is defined by Merchant Lane to the north, and alleyways to the east and south. Because the building evolved in an unplanned way through a series of additions to suit the requirements of various occupants, boundaries between the building's components are not always legible within the building's flexible interior spaces. Typical of industrial architecture, its exterior is generally utilitarian in nature and relatively unadorned. The property features multiple entrances, on all elevations, and its unique footprint creates exterior opportunities for social connection, particularly in the eastern alleyway, where communal spaces are bordered by a retaining wall.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The property at 221 Sterling Road is a rare and unique example of a former industrial complex that evolved to accommodate various manufacturing uses, and later gained prominence for its adaptive reuse as an incubator of arts and culture. Originally part of a site developed alongside the Grand Trunk Railway tracks for the Fairbanks-Morse Canadian Manufacturing Company Ltd., the property was constructed incrementally with an original portion from pre-World War I, interwar additions in c.1924-1939, and postwar additions in c.1954-1965. It served a variety of industrial uses through the mid- to late-twentieth century, and has since continued to evolve as a hub of cultural activities, housing a number of creative organizations and performance spaces. The property's gradual construction and adaptation produced an unusual, rambling complex with an interior that allows for reconfiguration to suit tenants' needs, and an exterior that creates moments of social connection. The building's physical value is expressed through industrial characteristics that facilitate adaptive reuse for live-work studios and light industrial cultural businesses.
&nbsp;
The property reflects the history of industrial development along Sterling Road within the lower Junction Triangle and Brockton Village areas, and contributes to a concentration of former industrial buildings, many of which now have cultural functions. It originated as part of lands developed by the Fairbanks-Morse Canadian Manufacturing Company Ltd. adjacent to the Grand Trunk Railway line. This company played an important role in the industrial development of the area through their development of a large manufacturing complex, including the subject property. Needs arising from Canada's involvement in the First World War meant that by the late 1910s, the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, like other plants in Toronto, received a munitions contract and manufactured explosive shells during this period. In addition to the theme of industrial development, the property reflects the theme of promotion of arts and culture through adaptive reuse of industrial buildings; this theme is especially significant to the local community. Few such examples of formerly industrial, live-work complexes remain extant in Toronto.
&nbsp;
The property is important in maintaining and supporting the character of Sterling Road as a former industrial streetscape, which has evolved as an area known for supporting arts and culture. In particular, it is linked to the adjacent property at 213 Sterling Road, which was also associated with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, and with which it stands in architectural dialogue. The only building of its kind on Sterling Road that continues to house a live-work community, 221 Sterling Road relates to surrounding industrial properties on Sterling Road that have been adaptively reused for the purposes of arts and culture.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The property at 1702 Queen Street East is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design and physical, historical and associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 1702 Queen Street East is located on the northwest corner of Queen Street East and Kingston Road in the Woodbine Beach neighbourhood. It contains the Imperial Bank of Canada Building, a two-storey bank building on a raised basement with a one-storey wing at the southwest corner. The property was constructed in 1911-12 as a branch of the Imperial Bank of Canada according to the designs of the well-known Toronto architects Sharp &amp; Brown. The property is ornamented with classical details. The property continued as a banking institution for much of the 20th century before becoming Murphy's Law Pub and Kitchen in 2001.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The Imperial Bank of Canada Building is valued for its design and physical value as a representative example of an early-20th century bank building with classical detailing. Applying classical details to bank edifices was popular throughout the early-to-mid-twentieth century in Toronto. Elements of the classical style are seen in the buff brick cladding with an ashlar cut limestone base and limestone detailing throughout, in the principal (south) elevation in the flat-headed window openings throughout with stone sills and lintels in the first-storey, in the rowlock course brick work below the window sills in the second-storey and in the square columns and capitals in the central window, in the ornamental stone frieze and brick cornice that rest upon the second-storey windows, in the stone surrounds enshrining the first-storey windows and the staircase door in the one-storey portion at the side (west) end of the building, and in the ornamentation of the main entryway, which contains a stone surround with a pediment above and scrolled volutes.
&nbsp;
Several of the classical details are carried through to the side (east) elevation, including the flat-headed windows with stone sills and rowlock course brick work below, the stone surrounds enshrining the first-storey windows with stone lintels, and the ornamental stone frieze and brick cornice that rest upon the second-storey windows. In the rear (north) elevation, the classical style is apparent in the brick quoining at the northeast corner. Similar to the side (east) elevation, some of the classical details present in the principal (south) elevation are carried through to the other side (west) elevation. There is a flat-headed window opening with a stone sill, the ornamental stone frieze and brick cornice that rests upon one of the second-storey windows is carried through, and the lintel above the westernmost window in the principal (south) elevation is also carried through.
&nbsp;
Historical or Associative Value
The property at 1702 Queen Street East is valued for its association with the architectural firm of Sharp &amp; Brown. While working under the prolific Toronto firm of Darling &amp; Pearson, the two entered into partnership in 1910, which lasted until 1919. While in partnership together, the two men designed six banks together including the Bank of Nova Scotia Building (1912) at 541 Queen Street East and the Bank of Nova Scotia Building (1913) at 79 Queen Street East. When Sharp opened a new office in 1919 with Herbert Horner, he continued to specialize in the design of classically inspired bank buildings.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
With its two-storey scale on a raised basement and one-storey wing at the southwest corner and its square form and massing, the property at 1702 Queen Street East is valued for supporting the historic character of the area. While the area has largely been redeveloped, the subject property is a rare surviving example of an early-20th century commercial building that was constructed on the north side of Queen Street East near Kingston Road to service new residents and visitors who were brought to the area by way of the Toronto Street Railway, which had their Woodbine Station located at the junction of Queen Street East and Kingston Road. Through its placement, setback, and orientation at the northwest corner of Queen Street East and Kingston Road where it is oriented to respond to and anchor its position at the junction of Queen Street East and Kingston Road, the Imperial Bank of Canada Building at 1702 Queen Street East is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its setting.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 50 Merton Street (Girl Guides of Canada Headquarters) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The property at 50 Merton Street contains the Girl Guides of Canada Headquarters,
a three-storey complex completed in 1962 to the design of Carmen Corneil, project architect for William J. McBain &amp; Associates and extended in 1970-72 by the partnership of Elin and Carmen Corneil.
&nbsp;
In 2011, the National Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the national significance of the Girl Guides of Canada through its designation of the Girl Guide of Canada Movement in Canada a National Historic Event and installed a plaque at 50 Merton Street.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Both the Midtown in Focus Cultural Heritage Resource Assessment (2016) and the City of Toronto OPA 405 identified the property as having potential cultural heritage value.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value - Girl Guides of Canada National Headquarters
The Girl Guides of Canada National Headquarters building, dating to 1961-2 with a 1970-72 extension is in its meticulous design an excellent representative of Post-War Modern architecture exhibiting in particular the influence of the great Finnish modernist, Alvar Aalto.&nbsp; It has also been acknowledged that on its completion the new headquarters was ""a building of consequence&hellip; representing something new and other, a different kind of architecture""[1] in Toronto.&nbsp; The building design is significant for its response to context, for its interpretation of the functional programmatic requirements as an opportunity for symbolic design and for creating a sequence of indoor and outdoor spaces which enrich the use and experience of Guides' members of all ages.&nbsp; In its interpretation of the brief, orientation on the site, composition and massing of the various programmatic components, in the choice of materials and in the details from the window openings to the handrails, columns and door pulls the building exhibits a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 50 Merton Street has association with the Girl Guides of Canada and in turn with the International Guiding Movement which is one of the largest youth movements in the world. The Guides were established in England in 1909 by Lord Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell shortly after the founding of the Boy Scouts in 1907. Canadian branches followed in 1910, the first in St. Catharines, Ontario and then Toronto. The core values of the organization emphasized the outdoors, character building, good citizenship and self-reliance with the motto: ""Be Prepared."" Since 1923, the guides have been largely self-funded through the sales of their iconic, trefoil-shaped cookies. Completed in 1962, the building was designed to be the first permanent, purpose-built national headquarters for the Girl Guides.&nbsp; Girl Guides are located across Canada and celebrated their centenary in 2010.&nbsp; The National Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the national significance of the organization through its designation of the Girl Guide of Canada Movement in Canada a National Historic Event.
&nbsp;
The Girl Guides of Canada Headquarters has associative value as it reflects the work and ideas of Carmen Corneil, lead designer and project architect for William J. McBain &amp; Associates who designed the original building in 1961-62 and the partnership of Elin and Carmen Corneil, for the addition undertaken in 1970-72. Throughout their 50+years of practice, Elin and Carmen Corneil have been influential as teachers and practitioners from their home-bases in Norway and Canada. Their work, which has included both architecture and urban design, has been recognized with two Massey Medals, won an international competition and has been published and exhibited widely. First living and working together in Toronto in 1960, their projects introduced a strong Scandinavian formal and typological influence which was based in expressive programmatic form, tactile materials and details, a variety of sources for daylight and the integration of landscape and nature. As their ideas and work evolved, these initial principles would be extended to eschew the formal aesthetic concerns of Modernism for an architecture that was underpinned by familiar building typologies related to a variety of individual and collective social experiences, with a frank tectonic expression inherent in Dutch Structuralism and particularly the work of Herman Hertzberger. Throughout their careers a primary commitment to architecture's enhancement of human experience through meaningful and connected place-making has been at the heart of their practice.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Set on the north side of Merton Street in the first block east of Yonge Street, the Girl Guides Headquarters, maintains and supports the character of the area which is related to its transformation following the completion of the Yonge Street subway line in 1954 making it a prime location for institutional uses such as the Visiting Home Nursing Association, The War Amps, the Geneva Centre for Autism and to the north of Davisville Avenue, the School for the Deaf (demolished).&nbsp; Its distinctive Post-War Modern design, low-rise scale and public outdoor space is shared with these other institutional buildings.&nbsp; Other low-rise buildings representing commercial and residential uses, with distinctive mid-century modern style maintain this character of Merton Street which is under transformation.
&nbsp;
Completed in 1962, the Girl Guides of Canada Headquarters is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings as it represents the transformation of Merton Street and the Davisville community following the completion of the subway line in 1954 with an increased institutional use, transforming the street's early mixed character of industrial and residential properties with a sequence of low-rise, Post-War Modern properties.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes of the Girl Guides of Canada National Headquarters
Design and Physical Value
The following heritage attributes contribute to the design and physical value of the
Girl Guides Headquarters at 50 Merton Street as an excellent representative of Post-War Modern architecture exhibiting in particular the influence of the great Finnish modernist, Alvar Aalto and as an example of the work of the partnership of Elin and Carmen Corneil as it responded to the project program and its Toronto context:&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 462 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design and physical, historical and associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 462 Wellington Street West is situated on the north side of Wellington Street West between Portland Street and Spadina Avenue in the King-Spadina neighbourhood. It contains the Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Building, a five-storey factory/warehouse type building that was constructed in 1917 for Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Ltd, one of the largest dealers in patent medicines in the country, according to the designs of Leon S. Yolles and Chapman &amp; McGiffenn, the latter who designed such notable buildings as Knox College at the University of Toronto. The property is fashioned in the Edwardian Classical style. The property was occupied for the greater portion of the 20th century by Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Ltd and now serves as an office building.
The property at 462 Wellington Street West was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on November 21 and 23, 1973. At the time, the property was known as the Houlding Knitwear Building, as Houlding Knitwear was a later occupant. The property is located within the proposed King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2017 and currently under appeal.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
&nbsp;
The Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Building is valued for its design and physical value as a representative example of an early-20th century factory/warehouse type building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood with Edwardian Classical detailing. The five-storey scale, rectangular form and massing, brick cladding with stone detailing, and flat roofline are characteristic of this building type. The Edwardian Classical style can be seen in the principal (south) elevation in the symmetrical arrangement of the openings, the segmental-arched openings in the first-storey, the flat-headed openings in the remaining four-storeys, the stone cladding that rises to the height of the second-storey windows with cut-stone detailing that wraps around the southeast and southwest corners, the bulbous stone sills sitting below the first-storey openings with a stone cornice above, the ornamental stone friezes that rest atop the second-storey openings and are decorated with scrollwork in the corners and stone cornices above, the stone lintels and sills in the openings of the upper three-storeys, and in the pilasters which are punctuated with stones cornices in the same storeys and the stone banding above that wraps around the southeast and southwest corners. The style is further evident in the side (east and west) elevations in the rhythmic arrangement of the segmental-arched openings, the stone sills and triple-layered arched brick detailing above, and in the central chimney in the side (east) elevation. Some of the window openings in the side (west) elevation have since been bricked in.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 462 Wellington Street West is valued for its association with Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Ltd, who commissioned the building to replace their earlier property on Front Street that had been destroyed by fire in 1904. The patent medicine company was started in Newcastle, Ontario, by Henry Stephen Northrop and John Lyman, both travelling salesmen from Auburn, New York. After buying out Tuttle and Moses and renaming it Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Ltd, they moved the company to Toronto after experiencing exponential growth. They were originally located at 40 Scott Street in 1874, then 21 Front Street West in 1879, and were temporarily located at 86-88 Richmond Street West before relocating to the subject property on Wellington Street West. The company became highly successful, and by the late-1870s, Northrop &amp; Lyman were being hailed as the largest dealers in patent medicines in the country.
They continued to occupy the property at 462 Wellington Street West until the late-20th century.
&nbsp;
The associative value of the property at 462 Wellington Street West is also through its connection with the two Toronto architectural firms of Leon S. Yolles and Chapman &amp; McGiffen. Yolles was an architect practicing in Toronto from 1910-1916 and designed various industrial and residential commissions for the Jewish community before WWI. Yolles was amongst the first Jewish architects to work in the province. By 1917, he changed his title to that of ""contractor"" and entered into a partnership with Harry Rotenberg, a lawyer, under the title of Yolles &amp; Rotenberg, Contractors. They operated one of the earliest property development companies in the city and designed and constructed several notable properties, such as the Hobberlin Building and the Sterling Tower. Alfred Hirschfelder Chapman and Robert B. McGiffin entered into partnership under the name Chapman &amp; McGiffen from 1908-19 and designed a wide variety of buildings, including Rosedale Presbyterian Church and Knox College at the University of Toronto.
&nbsp;
The property at 462 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community. The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place. As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Building.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Building at 462 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historic character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre. In King-Spadina, the property at 462 Wellington Street West reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses, including the Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Building, lined most of the street. Through its placement, setback, and orientation on the north side of Wellington Street West between Portland Street and Spadina Avenue, the Northrop &amp; Lyman Co. Building is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its setting where with the neighbouring heritage properties, it contributes to the enclave of former industrial buildings on Wellington Street West.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The properties at 508 and 510 Church Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, historical/associative value, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the west side of Church Street between Alexander and Maitland streets, the properties at 508 and 510 Church Street comprise two adjoining structures, originally constructed as residences in c.1856-1858.The properties are three storeys high with a complex cross-gabled roof. They are faced in brick with wood and stone trim, and have a raised basement level faced in rough stone. The properties have evolved physically and undergone a series of alterations in their 160-year history, including the integration of their interiors and the loss of the adjacent resident units of the historic row (now a parking lot). The other surviving unit is located at the corner of Church and Maitland streets.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The adjoining structures at 508 and 510 Church Street currently house Crews and Tangos, a drag performance venue, bar, and gathering space for the LGBTQ2S+ community. At the rear of the properties, a two-storey coach house is situated on Donna Shaw Lane and visible from the parking lot to the north. It is connected to the primary structures via a one-storey addition. Faced in brick, the coach house has a gabled roof, and the projecting gable ends with brick corbeling form a parapet with an unusual stepped silhouette. The coach house's ground floor currently includes a bar and a dance floor.
&nbsp;
In 2013, the painted brick exterior on Church Street was repainted with a mural by Nadijah Robinson and Elicser Elliott, depicting performers against a cobalt background. The artwork was one of 11 murals on 11 buildings as part of the Church Street Mural Project, led by Syrus Marcus Ware and James Fowler in association with the Church Wellesley Village Business Association and Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam. The initiative commemorated World Pride, which took place in Toronto in 2014.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The pair of structures at 508 and 510 Church Street constitute a unique example of semi-detached house-form structures from the mid-nineteenth century, constructed as part of a former row at 508-518 Church Street, and have since evolved for commercial use. They are notable for their asymmetrical configuration and details such as rounded arches and brickwork that demonstrate a vernacular application of Romanesque Revival stylistic influences, which were popular during the second half of the nineteenth century. The properties also retain a nineteenth-century coach house, located to the rear of 508 Church Street; though altered, this structure represents an increasingly rare typology within Toronto.
&nbsp;
The integrated properties hold direct associations with the evolution of the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood and with the more recent history of Toronto's LGBTQ2S+ community. The properties house Crews and Tangos (formerly Crews), one of Toronto's longest operating queer bars. The Crews and Tangos building has historical value as an iconic venue for queer community gatherings, rituals, performances, and cultural expression. Because the venue occupies a pair of former residences and a coach house, allowing it to spread across separate rooms and floors, it has the capacity to operate multiple bar spaces and dance floors simultaneously. These spaces cater to different activities and musical tastes, heightening the sense of inclusivity for which Crews and Tangos is noted.
&nbsp;
Located at the centre of the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood (also known as The Village), less than two blocks south of its eponymous intersection, the subject properties are important in defining the area's character. They contribute to an eclectic streetscape that features a variety of commercial typologies as well as a predominance of nineteenth-century residential buildings converted to commercial use, including 508 and 510 Church Street. The properties are also physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to their surroundings. For over four decades, Church and Wellesley has been the geographical heart of Toronto's LGBTQ2S+ community, with a concentration of queer community spaces, clubs, bars, restaurants, among which Crews and Tangos is considered an anchor. Operating since 1994, the Crews and Tangos building is a cultural landmark within the neighbourhood and for Toronto's broader LGBTQ2S+ community. Additionally, the mural added in 2013 for World Pride contributes to the building's status as a visual landmark.

2 Linden Street
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 2 Linden Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The three-storey, apartment block addition attached to the rear of 47 Huntley Street, known municipally as an active entrance at 2 Linden Street, was built in 1910 in the Edwardian Classicism style then broadly popular across Toronto and elsewhere. The principal (south) elevation facing onto Linden Street features a central entryway with an arched overhang roof, overtop of which a six-light window with decorative stained glass brings light into the main interior staircase. The six-unit apartment block is flanked by small balconies attached to the western and eastern elevations, which double as fire escapes. The horizontal roofline is supported by a decorative cornice which has been capped in tin or aluminium. Built in 1910, the apartment block addition speaks to a period in Toronto's early twentieth-century urban densification and growth which led to the 1912 municipal ban on the construction of purpose-built apartment blocks.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
&nbsp;
The expressive use of symmetry along the principal (south) elevation facing onto Linden Street - the central entryway, flanking window bays, and bookending balconies - are representative of the Edwardian Classicism style of the period. Further architectural details - the elliptical arch roof over the entryway (with decorative cornice detailing), the six-light stained glass window above, and the cornice detail along the roofline - highlight the extent of extant original details which retain a significant level of integrity. Lastly, the decorative brick masonry details, including the raised courses along the second and third stories, and the quoining detail at the eastern and western terminus' of the principal elevation, demonstrate the skill with which the fa&ccedil;ade was designed and built.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
&nbsp;
Contextually, the subject property at 2 Linden Street has significant cultural heritage value as a representative example of an early walk-up apartment block building within the heart of what was originally a late-nineteenth-century streetscape defined by a mix of stately mansions and middle-class single-family homes. Similar to its immediate neighbour at 8A Linden Street, and to several other similar vintage apartment additions and standalone apartment block buildings in the vicinity, 2 Linden Street holds contextual value as an important part of the evolution of the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood and of the Old City of Toronto generally.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The properties at 63-65 Huntley Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical, historical/associative, and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
The subject properties at 63-65 Huntley Street are comprised of a pair of semi-detached, Victorian-era, Italianate-influenced, Bay and Gable Style homes. The pair primarily fronts onto Huntley Street with additional side frontage along Selby Street for 65 Huntley Street and its two rear additions (1A-1B Selby Street). The subject properties were built in 1877 by local builder and architect A.H. Rundle (who occupied 63 Huntley Street), and includes two later additions to the rear of 65 Huntley Street. These additions consist of a 1926 apartment addition/conversion overtop the original rear wing of the house (adding a second storey and side entrances), as well as a later, 1949-built, two-storey, detached garage with upper-floor apartment.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The subject properties at 63-65 Huntley Street hold significant design/physical value as a fine, representative pair of semi-detached, Victorian-era, Italianate-influenced, Bay and Gable style homes. The high degree of integrity shared by the pair is demonstrated by the many original details present along the principal (front) elevation. These details include: dichromatic masonry with a yellow-brick base layer accented with decorative red-brick courses and arches around doorways, window openings, roofline, and corner quoining, original wooden doorways/doors and window openings, and wooden soffit and fascia supported by wooden brackets and a common, centre gable with intricate bargeboard detailing.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The subject property at 63 Huntley Street holds significant historical/associative value as the home of local builder and architect Arkless Harris Rundle (1847-1909) who built this and several other properties within the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. Rundle built and occupied the property between its construction in 1877 until his departure in 1884-1885. During this time, Arkless and his brother Charles bought up and developed several nearby lots, including a row of three contiguous homes at 7-11 Selby Street. Eventually, after having profited from the development the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood which he called home, A.H. Rundle commissioned a new, much grander home for he and his family at 15 Selby Street - the A.H. Rundle House (1888) by notable Toronto architect E.J. Lennox a testament to the enterprising Rundle brothers' success.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The subject properties at 63-65 Huntley Street hold significant contextual value as they define, maintain, and support the character of the surrounding streetscape and are physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to the development of the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. The high degree of architectural integrity and materiality of the semi-detached home, connects the property contextually to its neighbours along Huntley Street, with its intricate masonry fa&ccedil;ade, delicate brickwork, and wooden bargeboard detailing forming a physical link to the nearby, contiguous row of Bay and Gable style homes at 47-59 Huntley Street which were all built in the same period.

1 A Selby Street
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 1A Selby Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
Built overtop what was once a one-storey, light industrial structure attached to the rear of the main house, the 1926-built, Arts and Crafts style apartment conversion and addition is primarily confined to the second storey, albeit with a reconfigured side entrance which helps transition the addition to the original structure along the Selby Street elevation. The 1926-era, second-storey (and side entrance) portion of the apartment addition features stucco cladding with Tudor Revival half-timbering. The largely wooden, double side entrance is protected with a small portico roof with exposed rafter tails, which features two symmetrical pairs of wooden, intricately-composed, bracket-ended supports which frame each of the two identical doorways (one into 1A Selby Street, the other into the rear of 65 Huntley Street). Between these side doors stands an original, fixed, multi-light window pane.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The 1926-built, rear, two-storey apartment addition at the back of 65 Huntley Street holds design/physical value as a rare, unique example (within the area) of an Arts and Crafts-influenced piece of domestic architecture within what is predominantly a late nineteenth-century neighbourhood. Prominent design features include: the second floor apartment addition with stucco and Tudor Revival half-timbering and the ground-floor double side entrance with portico roof (supported by wooden brackets) with exposed rafter tails and a large, original, fixed-pane, multi-light window between the entryways. The ground floor is largely comprised of the original rear wing of the main house, and features many of the same masonry details: yellow-brick and corner quoining.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
An early twentieth-century addition to Upper Jarvis neighbourhood, 1A Selby is representative of the second major phase of development in the area, part of the same period of intensification which includes the 1910-built, three-storey apartment addition to the rear of 47 Huntley Street (2 Linden Street) and the construction of the adjacent, 1919-built, three-storey apartment next door at 8A Linden Street. The rear addition at 1A Selby also holds significant contextual value for its physical and functional connection to its surroundings - namely to 65 Huntley Street to which it is attached. Converted from a former malting house into an apartment, 1A Selby Street is indicative of a neighbourhood in transition.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
Design and Physical Value

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The properties at 16-18 Linden Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The properties at 16-18 Linden Street, dating to 1876, comprise a semi-detached pair of two-and-a-half-storey house-form buildings on the north side of Linden Street, between Huntley Street and Sherbourne Street. The pair represents the Bay and Gable typology and retains many intact features of Victorian architectural design. The buildings share a cross-gabled roof with two front gables; they are configured with a gable and a one-storey bay window on the west side of each half, and an entrance on each portion&rsquo;s east side. The front gables include decorative wood bargeboards with pierced details. On their primarily red-brick exteriors, the buildings demonstrate dichromatic brickwork, including a four-course buff-brick band above the stone foundation, single-course buff-brick banding at the upper storeys, and buff brick highlights above each window. Although the windows have been replaced, the buildings appear to retain their original fenestration patterns and segmentally arched openings. The raised entries constitute the primary distinction between the two buildings. At 16 Linden Street (the western half), the front door is slightly recessed within a wood portico, including four columns, a spindlework frieze, and fluted brackets. At 18 Linden Street (the eastern half), the front door is flush within an entryway that is entirely enclosed by brick, with a segmental arch and dichromatic brick details above a transom. Seeming to reflect a change in grade, another difference lies in the larger raised basement window visible within the projecting bay at 16 Linden Street. The properties have largely maintained their integrity as a pair.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1876, the properties at 16 and 18 Linden Street constitute representative examples of semi-detached Bay and Gable residences. The properties have maintained a high degree of integrity as a pair and retain many intact features that are typical of Victorian architectural design. Their composition features the quintessential combination of a front gable over a projecting bay of windows on each half of the pair. With red-brick exteriors featuring buff-brick trim, the properties demonstrate dichromatic brickwork, which grew popular as a design feature in Ontario during the 1870s and 1880s. Additional details of note include segmentally arched openings, decorative wood bargeboards with pierced details in the front gables, and, at 16 Linden Street, a wood portico with four columns, a spindlework frieze, and fluted brackets.
&nbsp;
Situated on the north side of Linden Street, between Huntley Street and Sherbourne Street, the properties at 16-18 Linden Street help to define and support the character of this block within the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. The buildings&rsquo; scale, form, massing, materials, and gabled roofline are consistent with and complementary to their surroundings, and their integrity as a pair with intact detailing lends them a degree of visual prominence in this context. The properties at 16-18 Linden Street are visually and historically linked to their surroundings. The pair dates to the earliest period of development in this area, and contributes to a streetscape largely consisting of late-nineteenth century house-form buildings.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 1-3 Selby Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical, historical/associative, and contextual values.

Description
The semi-detached house-form building at 1-3 Selby Street is comprised of a pair of 2-storey, brick dwellings constructed together in 1876. Situated on the south side of Selby Street, between Huntley Street and Sherbourne Street, the properties at 1-3 Selby Street help to define and support the character of this block within the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. The pair dates to the earliest period of development in this area, and contributes to a streetscape largely consisting of late-nineteenth-century house-form buildings including row houses, semi-detached and detached properties. The buildings&rsquo; scale, form, massing, materials, and roofline are consistent with and complementary to their surroundings, particularly the Queen Anne Revival styling of the heritage property at 15 Selby Street and Rundle Row at 7-11 Selby Street with its combination of Queen Anne Revival and Second Empire styling.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Design and Physical Value
Constructed in 1876, the properties at 1-3 Selby Street are valued as fine representative examples of semi-detached Second Empire style residences. The red brick-clad properties have maintained a high degree of integrity as a pair and retain many intact features that are typical of Victorian architectural design. Their composition features the quintessential Mansard roof with dormer windows contained highly decorative woodwork detailing and a projecting bay of windows on each half of the pair at the first-storey level. Additional details of note include the decorative slate shingling of the roof, projecting cornice below the roofline supported by decorative wooden brackets, the segmental-arched main entrances with transoms and the iron cresting surmounting the projecting bay window at 3 Selby Street.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The semi-detached pair of residences at 1-3 Selby Street are valued for their association with Hancock &amp; Townsend, a prominent architectural firm in Toronto which also designed the Equity Chambers, the first building in Toronto to incorporate passenger elevators.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Situated on the south side of Selby Street, between Huntley Street and Sherbourne Street, the two semi-detached properties at 1-3 Linden Street help to define and support the character of this block within the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. The buildings&rsquo; scale, form, massing, materials, and gabled roofline are consistent with and complementary to their surroundings, and their integrity as a pair with intact detailing lends them a degree of visual prominence in this context. The properties at 1-3 Selby Street are visually and historically linked to their surroundings. The pair dates to the earliest period of development in this area, and contributes to a streetscape largely consisting of late-nineteenth century house-form buildings.

RUNDLE ROW
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The properties at 7-11 Selby Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical, historical/associative, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Rundle Row at 7-11 Selby Street is comprised of three, 2-storey, brick residential row houses constructed together in 1880. Situated on the south side of Selby Street, between Huntley Street and Sherbourne Street, the properties at 7-11 Selby Street help to define and support the character of this block within the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. The row dates to the earliest period of development in this area, and contributes to a streetscape largely consisting of late-nineteenth-century house-form buildings including row houses, semi-detached, and detached properties. The buildings&rsquo; scale, form, massing, materials, and varied roofline are consistent with and complementary to their surroundings, particularly the Queen Anne Revival styling of the heritage property directly east at 15 Selby Street and the Second Empire features directly west at 1-3 Selby Street. Of the eight late-nineteenth century residential buildings fronting onto the south side of Selby Street, four were designed by the firm of McCaw &amp; Lennox (1876-1881), which included eminent Toronto architect, E.J. Lennox, and owned/built by one of the architecture firm's seemingly favoured contractors, Arkless H. Rundle. These include the heritage property at 15 Selby Street (A.H. Rundle House, 1888) and the subject properties at 7-11 Selby Street identified in this report as Rundle Row (1880). The small scale and compact nature of the row house typology at 7-11 Selby Street represents an interesting example of residential design by Lennox that departs from his more typical, large-scale, single-family detached dwellings.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Design and Physical Value
The properties at 7-11 Selby Street constitute a well-crafted and rare example of a late-nineteenth century residential row designed in the popular Queen Anne Revival style with Second Empire influences. They are particularly distinguished by the combination of a dichromatic slate mansard roofline with dormer windows broken with asymmetrically-arranged gables containing pebbledash infill or wood shingling. Alterations to the principal (north) elevations, including the wooden cladding at 7 and 9 Selby Street, and the east addition to 11 Selby Street with its excavated below-grade garage, adds to the eclectic and evolved design landscape of the street.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The row of three properties at 7-11 Selby Street are valued for their association with Arkless H. Rundle, a builder and land speculator who owned 7, 9, and 15 Selby Street as well as a number of lots on the north side of Selby Street. A.H. Rundle owned and occupied 9 Selby while his brother, Charles Rundle, a leading contractor in Toronto who worked with architect E. J. Lennox on various architectural projects, owned and occupied the attached property at 11 Selby. The Rundles are reported to have built at least nineteen homes in the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood during the late nineteenth century.
&nbsp;
Rundle Row is also valued for its associations with the eminent Toronto architect E. J. Lennox who is attributed with the design along with his business partner at the time, William Frederick McCaw. While Lennox is best known for local landmarks such as Toronto City Hall (Old City Hall) and Casa Loma, he also received numerous commissions for residential buildings in Toronto's upscale neighbourhoods, including the Part IV Designated A. H. Rundle House (1888) located directly east of the subject properties.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Situated on the south side of Selby Street, between Huntley Street and Sherbourne Street, the row of three attached dwellings at7-11 Selby Street help to define and support the character of this block within the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. The buildings&rsquo; scale, form, massing, materials, and gabled roofline are consistent with and complementary to their surroundings, and their integrity as a pair with intact detailing lends them a degree of visual prominence in this context. The properties at 7-11 Selby Street are visually and historically linked to their surroundings. The set dates to the earliest period of development in this area, and contributes to a streetscape largely consisting of late-nineteenth century house-form buildings.
&nbsp;
Historical or Associative Value

Historical connection to original architect and owner A.H. Rundle (1847-1909) who along with his brother Charles bought and developed several nearby plots in the area including 7-11 Selby Street
A.H Rundle occupied 63 Huntley Street between 1876-1877 and 1884-1886 before moving into two successive new homes designed by E.J. Lennox at 9 Selby Street then 15 Selby Street (1888)

&nbsp;
This notice is being served to the Owner of the Property, the Ontario Heritage Trust, and any Objectors and Interested Persons.
&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The properties at 49-59 Huntley Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The properties at 49-59 Huntley Street form part of a contiguous row of five near-identical, Victorian-era, Bay and Gable style, 2 1/2-storey homes (47-55 Huntley Street) attached to a slightly larger pair of near-identical, Victorian-era, Bay and Gable style, 2 1/2-storey homes (57-59 Huntley Street) - totalling a complete row of seven homes. All of the homes feature brick facades with brick detailing, wooden double-hung sash windows, transom windows, and decorative wooden gables with bargeboard detailing. Five of the seven homes within the row are configured as half bay and gables, as indicated by their one-storey bay windows paired with steep rooflines and decorative wooden gables - leaving a pair of taller, full bay and gable homes at the north end of the row. Some of the homes feature wrought iron dwarf parapets above their half bays. Considered as a row, the collection of homes date to the mid-1870s, and are among the earliest structures within the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
&nbsp;
The subject properties at 49-59 Huntley Street share considerable design value as part of a discreet, representative, collection of Victorian-era, half Bay and Gable style townhouses holding a significant degree of architectural integrity. The materiality and craftsmanship evident in the delicate brickwork (featuring raised courses of brick headers outlining architectural elements), and the mix of hand-carved and machine-turned millwork upon the wooden gables and bargeboard detailing, are all representative of a high degree of design and skilled execution.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
&nbsp;
Contextually, the subject properties at 49-59 Huntley Street hold significant cultural heritage value as they collectively support and maintain the architectural character of the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. Built 1874-1876, the subject properties are among the oldest surviving house-form structures in the vicinity, and together tell the story of the area's residential development during the late nineteenth century. Originally occupied by middle-class lawyers, bankers, civil engineers, and business owners, the subject properties are representative of the early demographic makeup of this fashionable corner of Victorian-era Toronto.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The properties at 79 and 81 Granby Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the south side of Granby Street, between Church and Yonge streets in the McGill-Granby Village community, the two semi-detached residential properties at 79 and 81 Granby Street were built together in 1891.
The properties were included together on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register on June 8, 2021.
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The pair are valued as a representative example of semi-detached Victorian-era dwellings whose design is typical of the Bay-n-Gable style with their 2.5-storey form and massing organized vertically on the principal (north) elevation into two bays, the outer one surmounted by a steep gable containing wooden detailing with the wide bargeboards and scalloped shingling. Richardsonian Romanesque design influence is evident in the surviving round-arched brick window opening on the first floor at 81 Granby and the (currently missing) round-arched, red brick entryway spanning the main entrance to both properties.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The pair are also valued for their historic association with local merchant and real estate developer, Robert Kidney, who was responsible for their construction and was their original owner as well as the three adjacent, mixed-use buildings at 414-418 Church Street that are already included on the City's Heritage Register. All five properties were purchased by Kidney in 1890 and the existing group of brick structures were completed the following year.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The properties at 79 and 81 Granby Street (standing between the adjacent Heritage Register properties at 414-418 Church Street to the east and 77 Granby Street to the west), together anchor the southwest corner of Church and Granby streets visually, physically and historically, where they embody a surviving collection of late-19th century buildings representative of an early period of land development in the Granby-McGill community.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
The Heritage Attributes of the properties at 79 and 81 Granby Street are:

The setback, placement and orientation of the semi-detached buildings on their lot on the south side of Granby Street west of Church Street
The scale, form and massing of the 2.5-storey rectangular plan
The materials, with the red brick cladding (currently stuccoed at 79 Granby Street) and the brick, stone and wood detailing
The mirrored gable roofline with its decorative shingling and wooden bargeboards in the gables on the principal (north) elevation
The principal (north) elevation of the semi-detached buildings, which is vertically organized into two mirrored bays with centred main entrances and roof gables in the outer bays
The organization of the window openings on the principal (north) elevation (N.B. the original round-arched opening seen at 81 Granby Street is currently flat-headed at 79 Granby Street and would be preferable if returned to its original state)
The brick and stone detailing with the raised brick string courses at the first and second storeys the corbelled hood moulds above the second storey window openings (at 81 Granby Street) and all existing rough-hewn stone sills&nbsp; The organization of the main entrances, centred at the first-storey level (N.B. the shared, round-arched, brick entryway spanning the main entrances at 79-81 Granby Street has been replaced with a shared flat-headed opening and would be preferable if returned to its original state)

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 1 St. Clair Avenue West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Located on the southwest corner of St. Clair Avenue West and Yonge Street in the city&rsquo;s Deer Park neighbourhood, the property at 1 St. Clair Avenue West contains a twelve-storey commercial building completed in 1968. At the time of its completion, the ground floor continued to be occupied by the CIBC branch, and the remaining floors leased out to various commercial tenants. A decade later, the building was identified as &ldquo;Ontario Government Building&rdquo; in the City Directory, and tenants included a range of Ontario ministries. In 1992, exterior alterations were carried out on the CIBC bank branch fronting onto Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue West. In 2016, an eight-storey mural was commissioned for the building&rsquo;s west elevation by owner, Slate Asset Management, in collaboration with STEPS Public Art, to the design of renowned British street artist, Phlegm.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property has design and physical value as a significant and unique representative example of architectural precast concrete in Toronto. Constructed in 1967-1968, to a design largely conceived by 1963, this prominently sited modernist office building anchoring the southwest corner of the Yonge and St. Clair intersection in midtown is characterized by the treatment of its principal north, east and south elevations. These principal elevations were constructed as a unitized curtain wall system entirely composed of non-structural prefabricated panels on the exterior. Each is distinguished by a uniform arrangement of narrow precast concrete panels with rectangular openings with rounded corners, and the visual contrast between the slender concrete elements and the large inset windows creates a vibrant pattern of light and shadow. This distinctive and elegant design is characteristic of the versatility of precast concrete, and of the range of buildings associated with this material and construction method during the Modern period in Toronto.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property at 1 St. Clair Avenue West is also valued as a unique and prominent example of the physical and design evolution of St. Clair Avenue in the Deer Park neighbourhood from a mainly low-rise, residential community in the early-20th century to the high-rise, commercial canyon that developed along this stretch in the 1950s-1970s and continues to define the east-west axis of this important midtown intersection today.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The property has contextual value in supporting the character of St. Clair Avenue within Deer Park. Completed in 1968, the building on the property is the first of the four corners at the Yonge and St. Clair intersection and among a larger wave of modern office buildings which transformed and established the area&rsquo;s character during its post-war intensification in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to its present-day character as a mixed-use and commercial hub. Occupying a visible site at the intersection of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue, the building contributes to the canyon form of St. Clair Avenue created by surrounding buildings between Avenue Road and the Vale of Avoca. The commercial building at 1 St. Clair Avenue West is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting in the Deer Park neighbourhood where it anchors the southwest corner of St. Clair Avenue and Yonge Street.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
Attributes that contribute to the value of the commercial high-rise building at 1 St. Clair Avenue West being a significant and unique representative example of modernism in Toronto:

The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of St. Clair Avenue and Yonge Street
The existing twelve-storey scale, form and massing on a rectangular plan with a flat roof&nbsp;&nbsp;
The materials, with the concrete, brick and glass cladding
On the north, east and south elevations, the curtain wall system of precast concrete panels above the first storey and rising to the flat roof, with their modular and uniform arrangement, deep profile and rectangular openings with rounded corners&nbsp;
The precast concrete panels at the corners, parapet and ground floor fascia which frame the north, east and south elevations

&nbsp;
Description
The subject properties at 544 and 550 Queen Street East is located on the northwest corner of Queen Street East and River Street in the historic Corktown neighbourhood. The properties are comprised of two former factory buildings, the former National Electric Heating Co. Ltd. the former New Method Laundry Co, Ltd. which were brought together in 1982-83 as part of the property's adaptive reuse, which linked the structures together across their Queen Street elevations via the construction of a large glass atrium. The atrium serves as the main entry into the complex and is used as a shared common space. Previous major alterations include the c. 1917 addition of a fourth storey to the former National Electric Heating Co. Ltd. building and the 1923 addition of a third storey and new second-storey sign band (in place of the original cornice) to the former New Method Laundry Co. Ltd. building.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
The properties at 544 and 550 Queen Street East, with entrance addresses at 554 Queen Street East, 2 and 10 River Street, contain two buildings, the former National Electric Heating Co. Ltd. building and the former New Method Laundry Co. Ltd. building. They are both designed in the Edwardian Classicism style and are representative examples of an early-twentieth-century, industrial warehouse/factory building type, within an urban setting.
The building formerly occupied by the National Electric Heating Co. Ltd., is valued for its design and physical value as representative of the Edwardian Classicism style, in its generally understated and unadorned red Ontario size brick facades, with some classically inspired features most evident in the design of the entrance doorway feature fronting onto Queen Street East. The doorway contains classically inspired elements typically found in the Edwardian Classicism style buildings in Ontario, such as the dichromatic material composition, Tuscan style columns and exaggerated and projecting keystone and a combination of stone and brick voussoirs are reminiscent of sixteenth century Italian Mannerist architecture.&nbsp; The building is also valued as a representative example of the industrial warehouse/factory building type, located within an urban setting, recognizable by its rectangular plan and flat roof form, located with its front elevation on or close to the property line. Its unadorned brick fa&ccedil;ade with precast concrete (""artificial stone"") construction, designed to maximize open spaces within and openings for windows along the front elevation to bring daylight into the working spaces, is also representative of the building's industrial warehouse/factory type. Its symmetrical arrangement and equally sized bays, vertically divided by brick pilasters and large square masonry openings for windows make them dominant features in the composition resulting in a greater percentage of glazed compared to solid areas in the fa&ccedil;ade which are characteristic of the type. The building also reflects the type in the lack of embellishment in the execution of the fourth-level brick addition and the segmental arched punched windows of building's east and west elevation.&nbsp;
The building constructed for the New Method Laundry Co. Ltd, is valued for its design and physical value as representative of the Edwardian Classicism style, in its generally understated and unadorned red brick facades, with some classically inspired features most evident in the design of the entrance doorway feature fronting on River Street. The exaggerated keystones and projecting voussoirs in precast stone are reminiscent of sixteenth century Italian Mannerist architecture, and are features that are often found in Edwardian Classical buildings in Ontario. The masonry work and materials, are also characteristic of the style, with their dichromatic composition highlighting selected classically inspired architectural elements. The building is also valued for its design and physical value as a representative of the industrial warehouse/factory type, built in the early twentieth century within an urban setting. The type is evident in its setting within an urban context, with its large rectangular form and massing reflecting executed in unadorned brick and precast concrete facades, composed to maximize openings for windows along street-facing facades, with a greater percentage of glazed areas compared to solid areas, to bring daylight into the working spaces and located closely following the street facing property lines. The unadorned design of the third storey, added in 1923, as well as the side addition's facade on River Street are part of the evolution of the industrial warehouse/factory type building.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The subject properties at 544 and 550 Queen Street East (comprised of two former factory structures) holds significant historical value as the site of various industrial and commercial tenants which occupied each of these two structures for more than 70 years from 1910-1982. These tenants include the National Electric Heating Co. Ltd. and New Method Laundry Co. Ltd. and their successors, which were part of a larger collection of manufacturing interests once central to the historic Corktown neighbourhood.
The former New Method Laundry building holds additional historical value for its association with Toronto architect J.A. MacKenzie (1876-1946) who designed this and several other prominent structures across the city. The original design elements retained in the first two storeys (and raised basement) of the structure's Queen and River Street elevations tie this structure to other of the architect's work, including the Lumsden Building (1909) at 2-6 Adelaide Street East designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1978 and the original fa&ccedil;ade of the Madison Theatre (1913) at 506 Bloor Street West.
MacKenzie's skill and preference for working with material such as the use of precast concrete as seen at the Lumsden Building and specifically on this building as found upon the main entryway, with its exaggerated keystone and voussoir details and evidenced by archival images of the original cornice, the use of prominent dentilles and the placement of a large overhanging portico roof (no longer extant), ties the subject property to MacKenzie's other work.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The subject properties at 544 and 550 Queen Street East hold contextual value for their role in defining, maintaining, and supporting the historic, turn-of-the-century, industrial character of the Queen/River corridor and the Corktown neighbourhood. A site of heavy industry for 150 years, Corktown's urban fabric continues to be informed by its industrial past - a fact which the subject property effectively supports and upholds. In their scale, massing, and materiality, the two former factory structures contained within the property are physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to their surroundings and significantly contextualize and inform the architectural and cultural heritage of the area.
The properties hold additional contextual value as an early example of adaptive reuse within Corktown and larger King-Parliament area. The site's evolution over the last century, from industrial to commercial use, signified by the conversion of the two former factory buildings therein from manufacturing to creative industries, represents a formative part of the broader narrative of this neighbourhood's ongoing transformation.
&nbsp;
Design and Physical Value
Attributes that contribute to the value of the properties at 544 and 550 Queen Street East as being a representative example as representative of the Edwardian Classicism style are:
&nbsp;

Reasons for Designation
The properties at 1196 (including entrance addresses at 1198 Yonge Street and 2 Birch Avenue), 1202 and 1204 Yonge Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design and physical, historical and associative, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The Main Street Commercial Block building at 1196-1204 Yonge Street is located at the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Birch Avenue &ndash; a historic transit hub in the City's north end where a busy Yonge Street thoroughfare intersected at grade with the CPR rail line and its train station south of the tracks, as well as the proposed southern terminus of the Toronto and York Radial Company streetcar line whose tracks and terminals were planned and partially executed just west of Yonge Street from Farnham to Birch Avenue in 1911-1912 before the project was reversed by order of Privy Council in the following year.
The City's regrading of this portion of Yonge Street to increase pedestrian and vehicular safety through grade separation between the street and the CPR tracks in 1914-1916 transformed this unique Main Street Commercial Block building originally completed as a three-storey structure in 1889. Over a series of alterations and excavation on the east and south elevations of the subject building in response to this major infrastructural project the basement level was exposed, increasing the building height by one-storey and requiring relocation of the original storefronts to this newly defined street level. The creatively adaptive four-storey conversion resulting from this unique situation is prominently situated directly north of the CPR rail line that necessitated the vehicular underpass/rail overpass where it crosses Yonge Street at the edge of the city's Summerhill neighbourhood. The subject building, together with the abutting Main Street Commercial Row at 1206, 1208 and 1210 Yonge Street (1907-1908), anchor the northwest quadrant of this historically significant intersection of Yonge Street and the railway crossing and stands as a remnant portion of the area's streetscape condition prior to the early-20th century projects culminating in the current configuration of transportation infrastructure at this location.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The existing four-storey, brick, Main Street Commercial Block-type building at 1196-1204 Yonge Street is valued as a significant representative example of the commercial and residential main street row buildings constructed in Toronto during the Late-Victorian era that, in this case, is also unique for its creative adaptation of an existing late-19th century building to the regrading of this portion of Yonge Street (1914-1916) to accommodate a new vehicular underpass/railway overpass across Yonge for the intersecting CPR rail line. The architectural response to the new topography of the site required excavation and exposure of the basement level for relocation of the original storefronts to align with and permit pedestrian access at the newly lowered and sloped street grade. This physical adaptation and evolution of the building is valued as an enhancement to the original design rather than a detraction.&nbsp;
The east elevation of the red brick Main Street block maintains its overall 1889 design, style and detailing including its five-bay vertical arrangement delineated by brick pilasters, a regular rhythm of largely symmetrically-arranged window openings at the upper two storeys with continuous brick string-coursing and drip-mouldings, and detailed cornice woodwork with carved scroll brackets surmounted by distinctive ""birdhouse""-shaped capitals that wrapped around the corner of the building at the east end of the south elevation.
Alterations to the 1889 building are evident in the addition of an exposed basement level during the regrading of Yonge Street followed soon after by the relocation of the original storefronts down to this lower level, and the new second storey (former first storey) refitted for additional residential units in keeping with the original two upper storeys. Though a bay-by-bay approach to reconfiguration of the new second storey spaces eschewed plans for a unified design for their east elevations, the bricking in of the large original storefront openings and their replacement with smaller, punched sash windows in vertical alignment with the two upper storeys clearly indicates the intention to transform this level functionally, formally and visually from retail to residential use in keeping with the two storeys above.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The building at 1196-1204 Yonge Street is valued for its association with the widening and regrading of this portion of Yonge Street in 1914-1916, a contentious and highly publicized infrastructural project involving the City of Toronto, the Toronto and York Radial Company and Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The resulting 2.5 degree slope of Yonge Street to produce an 18ft height clearance below a new rail overpass is physically manifested in the adapted and enhanced form of the subject property from a three- to four-storey building by excavating and exposing the original building's basement level as retail space to align with the new street grade. The 1889 wooden cornice stretching across the top of the current second storey on the east and (part of the south) elevations, survives as a reminder of the location of the 1889 storefronts and the original grade of the street, as does a floating door on the Birch Avenue (south) elevation.
All of these elements contribute to an understanding of the building's physical and design evolution while maintaining many of its original features that yield an understanding of the earlier, historic condition of this portion of Yonge Street where it crossed the railway tracks at grade. The building is also valued for the information it yields about the turbulent political situation created by the ensuing civic transportation infrastructure project involving all levels of government including the Privy Council of Canada, as well as the City Beautiful movement during which it was undertaken &ndash; an early urban planning effort promoting civic beauty through architectural and urban design, of which the heritage-designated Beaux-Arts style North Toronto Rail Station designed by Darling &amp; Pearson in 1916 on the southeast quadrant of this intersection stands as the crown jewel following its own adaptations to the concurrent infrastructure activity on site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the property has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the historic character of this portion of Yonge Street. Situated at the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Birch Avenue, it is an important contributor as it maintains the late-19th to early-20th century main street commercial built form evolution of the area. Here, a historic precinct is formed at three of four points where Yonge Street intersects with the CPR overpass, anchored by the landmark CPR North Toronto Station (1916) with the adjoining late-19th century commercial buildings at 1095-1099, 1101 and 1105 Yonge and, on the west side of Yonge south of the tracks, the collection of ten late-19th to early-20th century properties at 1148-1176 Yonge Street as well as the former Pierce Arrow Showroom (1930) at 1140 Yonge.&nbsp; All of the latter sites are recognized on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register for their cultural heritage value.
The Main Street Commercial Block building at 1196-1204 Yonge Street is historically, visually, functionally and physically linked to its surroundings where it anchors the northwest corner of Yonge Street and Birch Avenue as a significant example of its type with its massing and stylistic details characteristic of the late-19th century and typically located along the city's main commercial thoroughfares. The early-20th century conversion of the subject building at 1196-1204 Yonge Street from three- to four storeys speaks to the inextricable historical, visual, functional and physical linkages of the property's evolved form to contemporary civic infrastructural changes required by the adjacent and pre-existing CPR rail line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Description
Built in 1907-1908, the set of three Main Street Commercial Row buildings at 1206-1210 Yonge Street is located on the west side of Yonge Street just north of Birch Avenue &ndash; a historic transit hub in the City's north end where a busy Yonge Street thoroughfare intersected at grade with the CPR rail line and its train station south of the tracks, as well as the proposed southern terminus of the Toronto and York Radial Company streetcar line whose tracks and terminals were planned and partially executed just west of Yonge Street from Farnham to Birch Avenue in 1911-1912 before the project was reversed by order of Privy Council in the following year.
The City's regrading of this portion of Yonge Street to increase pedestrian and vehicular safety through grade separation between the street and the CPR tracks in 1914-1916 resulted in partial excavation of the basement level and the addition of raised and recessed entry stairs to the main storefront entrances at 1206 and 1208 Yonge Street to align with this newly defined street level. The subject buildings, together with the abutting Main Street Commercial Block at 1196-1204 Yonge Street (1889), anchor the northwest quadrant of this historically significant intersection of Yonge Street the CPR rail line that necessitated the vehicular underpass/rail overpass where it crosses Yonge Street at the edge of the city's Summerhill neighbourhood, standing as a remnant portion of the area's streetscape condition prior to the early-20th century projects culminating in the current configuration of transportation infrastructure at this location.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The collection of three, 2-storey, brick Main Street Commercial Row-type buildings at 1206-1210 Yonge Street is valued as a significant representative example of the commercial and residential main street row buildings constructed in Toronto during the Edwardian era. The principal (east) elevations fronting onto Yonge Street maintains much of its 1907-1908 design, style and detailing including the floor-to-ceiling storefront window openings with off-set entrances at street level with wooden cornice above, centred bay window with brick header at the second storey, and all surmounted by a decorative brickwork cornice at the roofline at 1206 and 1210.
Archival photos indicate that the middle property at 1208 Yonge Street originally contained a semi-circular parapet wall that has since been removed.
The architectural response to the newly lowered and sloped street grade along this portion of Yonge Street required the addition of raised and recessed stairs up to the main entrances on the principal (east) elevations to permit pedestrian access. The properties at 1206-1208 1206-1208 include a short flight of entrance steps that lead up to a recessed ground floor entrance while the stairs at 1210 Yonge are internal to the entrance. This physical adaptation and evolution of the entry stairs is valued as an enhancement to the original design rather than a detraction.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The row of mixed-use buildings at 1206-1210 Yonge Street, along with the adjacent corner property at 1196-1204 Yonge is valued for its association with the widening and regrading of this portion of Yonge Street in 1914-1916, a contentious and highly publicized infrastructural project involving the City of Toronto, the Toronto and York Radial Company and Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The resulting 2.5 degree slope of Yonge Street to produce an 18ft height clearance below a new rail overpass is physically manifested in the adapted entries of the subject properties by partially excavating and exposing the original basement to align with the new street grade.
All of these elements contribute to an understanding of the collection's physical and design evolution while maintaining many of the original features that yield an understanding of the earlier, historic condition of this portion of Yonge Street where it crossed the railway tracks at grade. The properties are also valued for the information they yield about the turbulent political situation created by the ensuing civic transportation infrastructure project involving all levels of government including the Privy Council of Canada, as well as the City Beautiful movement during which it was undertaken &ndash; an early urban planning effort promoting civic beauty through architectural and urban design, of which the heritage-designated Beaux-Arts style North Toronto Rail Station designed by Darling &amp; Pearson in 1916 on the southeast quadrant of this intersection stands as the crown jewel following its own adaptations to the concurrent infrastructure activity on site.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, the set of three Main Street Commercial Row buildings have cultural heritage value for maintaining and supporting the historic character of this portion of Yonge Street. Situated together on the west side of Yonge Street between Birch Avenue and Alcorn Avenue, along with the adjacent Main Street Commercial Block building at 1196-1204 Yonge, the properties survive as important contributors in maintaining the late-19th to early-20th century main street commercial built form evolution of the area. Here, a broader historic precinct is formed at three of four points where Yonge Street intersects with the CPR overpass, anchored by the landmark CPR North Toronto Station (1916), with the adjoining late-19th century commercial buildings at 1095-1099, 1101 and 1105 Yonge and, on the west side of Yonge south of the tracks, the collection of ten late-19th to early-20th century properties at 1148-1176 Yonge Street as well as the former Pierce Arrow Showroom (1930) at 1140 Yonge.&nbsp; All of the latter sites are recognized on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register for their cultural heritage value.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 1117 Queen Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The property at 1117 Queen Street West is located on the south side of Queen Street West between Lisgar Street and Abell Street in the West Queen West neighbourhood, and contains the former Postal Station 'C', a two-storey building completed in 1903. The Beaux-Arts building was designed by the architecture branch of the federal Department of Public Works, with S.G. Curry acting as the local associate architect.
&nbsp;
The property is uniquely positioned in that it is surrounded on all four sides by the public realm, facilitating visibility and access to all four of the building's elevations. On the north and east, the property abuts the adjacent street and sidewalk. To the west, a narrow extension of Lisgar Park connects to Queen Street West, and a public laneway running along the south property line has been integrated into the design of Lisgar Park.
&nbsp;
The property was listed on the City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties (now the Heritage Register) on June 20, 1973, and is located within the proposed West Queen West Heritage Conservation District. The property is part of a collection of former institutional buildings within the West Queen West area, including the former Queen and Lisgar Library (1115 Queen Street West, designated Part IV in 2012) on the opposite side of Lisgar Street that has been adaptively reused as the Theatre Centre.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Postal Station 'C' is valued for its design and physical value as an early example of the stripped Beaux-Arts style applied to federal buildings at the beginning of the 20th century. The two-storey square form and massing with rear loading area, brick cladding with stone detailing, and flanking entrances are characteristic of post offices contemporary to this era. The Beaux-Arts influences can be seen in the flat roofline, symmetrical composition of the four elevations, the double height pilasters, the metal cornice, rusticated stone base and stringcourses that wrap the entirety of the building, and the round arched openings on the ground floor and flat-headed openings on the upper floor.
&nbsp;
The property at 1117 Queen Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the West Queen West neighbourhood, with Queen Street West serving as the dividing line between the Park Lots and the Military Reserve that were established in 1793. The large lots on the south side of the street that were gradually parceled out from the Military Reserve lands for institutional use to support the growing City contrast with the ad hoc subdivision and narrower lots on the north side of the street.
&nbsp;
The property at 1117 Queen Street West is further valued for its association with the architecture branch of the Department of Public Works of Canada, which was formed in 1871 and contributed significantly to establishing a cohesive and recognizable image for federal buildings across the nation. Under the tenure of Chief Architect David Ewart from 1897-1914, the Department of Public Works designed and constructed hundreds of federal buildings across Canada, including over 180 post offices. Postal Station 'C' introduced the modest and stripped down aesthetic that reflected the emphasis on rational and prudent use of public funds, whilst maintaining an appropriate appearance of civic grandeur. The Department of Public Works replicated these ideas in other projects constructed across the country.
&nbsp;
Located on the south side of Queen Street West, the red brick and stone building at 1117 Queen Street West has contextual value for its contribution to the historical character of the West Queen West area, which is typified by narrow lots with commercial buildings on the north side of the street, and large lots originally held for institutional use on the south side of the street (the former Military Reserve lands). Like several other buildings on the south side of Queen Street West, all four elevations are visible from the public realm. This section of Queen Street West is part of the proposed West Queen West Heritage Conservation District.
&nbsp;
The contextual value of Postal Station 'C' is also demonstrated by its historical and visual links to its surroundings on Queen Street West, where it contributes to an important collection of institutional buildings along this section of the street, including the neighbouring Queen and Lisgar Library (1115 Queen Street West), the Dovercourt YMCA (1089 Queen Street West), and the extant walls of the former Provincial Lunatic Asylum. These properties are connected through their creation in 1888 when the east and west portions of the Asylum grounds were subdivided and subsequently sold.
Postal Station 'C' is considered a local landmark.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
Design and Physical Value
The following heritage attributes contribute to the value of the property at 1117 Queen Street West as an early example of stripped Beaux-Arts principles applied to a federal building:

The setback, placement, and orientation of the building on the south side of Queen Street West between Abell and Lisgar streets
The scale, form and massing of the building that rises two stories above the rusticated stone base, including the projecting corner bays with their double height brick piers
The materials including the red brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing
The flat roofline, brick parapet and the metal cornice
The round arched openings on the ground floor and the flat arched openings on the second floor on all four elevations
Rusticated stone stringcourses accenting the level of the springline on the ground floor openings and the sill level for the second floor windows, on all four elevations
The symmetrical organization of the building's four elevations
On the north elevation, the two flanking entrances raised above grade and accessed by wide stairways and landings
On the south elevation, the two symmetrically arranged brick chimneys next to the projecting corner bays

&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
Attributes that contribute to the value of the property as connecting to the building program of the Department of Public Works of Canada:

On the north elevation, the two flanking entrances (one for public access and one for private access) and the upwardly projecting stone nameplate inscribed with ""Postal Station C""
The use of the stripped Beaux-Arts style that reflected the emphasis on the prudent use of public funds, whilst maintaining an appropriate appearance of civic grandeur on all four elevations

Contextual Value
Attributes that contribute to the value of the property as defining, supporting and maintaining the historic character of the area, being historically, visually, functionally and physically linked to their setting, and being considered a landmark within the West Queen West neighbourhood:

The two-storey scale, form, and massing, and flat roof
The materials including the red brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing
The setback, placement, and orientation of the property on the south side of Queen Street West between Abell and Lisgar streets, and adjacent to Lisgar Park which allows all four elevations of the building to be viewed from the public realm

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 625 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, historical/associative value, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The subject property consists of two adjoining buildings that are related historically and architecturally: a northern building at 631-637 Yonge Street/1-5 Isabella Street, and a southern building at 625-629 Yonge Street. Together, they are known municipally as 625 Yonge Street. Located on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Isabella Street, the brick buildings are three storeys with a flat roof. The west and north elevations can be viewed together from the intersection. With the delineated bays along its front elevation, the property is consistent with the rhythm produced by fine-grained building frontages along the surrounding historic commercial streetscape. The buildings' Edwardian Classicist style is one of several architectural styles that predominate in the area.
It was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2016. The property is identified as a contributing property in the Historic Yonge Street Heritage Conservation District, adopted by City Council in 2016 and currently under appeal.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
The property consists of two adjoining buildings that constitute a representative example of Edwardian Classicist-style commercial main street buildings. Although the northern building predates the southern, they share their brick construction and the datum lines of their common floor levels and banding details, and read as an integrated whole. Designed by J. Wilson Gray, the northern building (631-637 Yonge Street/1-5 Isabella Street) retains quoins and exaggerated voussoir details above round-arched window openings on the upper storey of each elevation's corner bay. Both elevations also feature segmentally arched lintels at the third storey, and stone banding above the second and third storeys, with the latter giving the appearance of a simple cornice. The southern building (625-629 Yonge Street), likely designed by Chapman &amp; McGiffin, has a symmetrical composition divided by brick pilasters, large window openings at both the second and third storey, stone sills and banding that continue the lines of the northern building, and a brick parapet with a curving, stepped design. Despite the removal of the original windows, both buildings' original fenestration patterns remain intact.
&nbsp;
The property is directly associated with the theme of early-twentieth-century commercial development along Yonge Street. Specifically, from construction in c.1905-1907 (631-637 Yonge Street/1-5 Isabella Street) and c.1913-1921 (625-629 Yonge Street) until the early 1950s, the property maintained its association with the automotive industry. This significant association included the property's original use for Thomas Crow's carriage business, representing the automotive industry's origins. The property continued to reflect the industry's evolution as it housed the Dominion Automobile Company's showroom, the second store location of Canadian Tire in the 1930s, and other automobile companies until the early 1950s.
&nbsp;
Additionally, the property holds associations with a series of clubs that served the LGBTQ2S+ community, notably including the Domino Club and Komrads in the 1980s. As a longstanding venue that reflected the prevalence of LGBTQ2S+ establishments along Yonge Street and remained connected to the community after it shifted eastward to the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, the building has the potential to yield information that contributes to an understanding of Toronto's LGBTQ2S+ history.
&nbsp;
The property is important in maintaining and supporting the historic commercial main street along this portion of Yonge Street, which is characterized by a low-scale continuous streetwall condition. With the delineated bays along its front elevation, the property is consistent with the rhythm produced by fine-grained storefronts along the streetscape. The buildings' Edwardian Classicist style is one of several architectural styles that predominate in the area. As part of Yonge Street's historic commercial streetscape since the early 20th century, with connections to concentrations of automotive companies and later LGBTQ2S+ establishments, the property is physically, functionally, visually, and historically linked to its surroundings.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
Design and Physical Value
The following heritage attributes contribute to the cultural heritage value of the property at 625 Yonge Street as a pair of Edwardian Classicist-style commercial main street buildings:

The scale, form, and massing of the property as a three-storey pair of adjoining flat-roofed commercial buildings
The property's material palette, consisting of brick with stone detailing
The consistent datum lines of the two buildings' common floor levels and the stone banding details that continue across both buildings, allowing them to be read as an integrated whole
The northern building's asymmetrical composition with elevations on both Yonge and Isabella streets, including a projecting bay on both elevations that emphasizes the building's corner siting
The southern building's symmetrical composition with three bays defined by four brick pilasters

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 125 Sylvan Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical, associative/historical, and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The property at 125 Sylvan Avenue is situated southeast of Kingston Road and Markham Road in Scarborough Village atop of the Scarborough Bluffs. It contains the McNeel House, a one-storey, Mid-Century Modern home constructed in 1963 for Dr. Burdett Harrison McNeel and his wife Helen B. McNeel by Modernist architect James Albert Murray (1919-2008). The McNeel House has an expansive view of Lake Ontario from above Sylvan Park, which spans the bottom of the Bluffs below a row of homes.
&nbsp;
In 2018, the McNeel House was recognized by Heritage Toronto with a historic plaque to the left of the front driveway along Sylvan Avenue. The plaque pays respect to the McNeel family and to architect James Murray's use of post-and-beam construction paired with natural materials, including stone and cedar, which are among the central elements of the McNeel House's Modernist design.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Design and Physical Value
Completed in 1963, the property at 125 Sylvan Avenue is valued as a fine and unique example of a custom-designed Mid-Century Modern house in Toronto, showcasing Modernist style residential design ideals adapted to the Canadian context. The Modernist style's emphasis on the understanding of the properties of materials, program needs, and artistic architectural expression achieved through minimal decoration is most evident at 125 Sylvan Avenue in the use and expression of the wooden post-and-beam structural system in the garage and walkway structures, and the inclusion of wood-clad steel in the main house to achieve open plan areas and create a distinction between the structural grid and the other architectural elements (roof, partition walls, hearth, and glazed areas). These concepts respond to the site's specific context at 125 Sylvan Avenue in the composition of solid areas for walls, openings and floor-to-ceiling glazing (in the main house), as well as serving to visually merge the interior and exterior space. This transcending connection between the interior and exterior is particularly evident in the procession of arrival on and across the property by vehicle, pedestrian access under the covered walkway, view of the orange front door, entry into the front foyer and through the Japanese Shōji, rice paper sliding doors, revealing the unobstructed views of Lake Ontario from the principal rooms of the main house.
&nbsp;
The property displays a high degree of artistic merit for the ways in which its custom-designed composition (site planning, form, scale, choice of materials and architectural detailing) adapts Modernist style Canadian residential ideals further, to the regional level by a Toronto-based architect. The artful distinction of architectural elements expressed using a combination of natural and manufactured materials with minimal detailing for the structure, roof, partition walls, glazed areas, openings and hearth serves to connect the artificial/built structures to their natural setting atop the Scarborough Bluffs and maximize the property's views of Lake Ontario. A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the overall design, which is a thoughtfully balanced minimalistic architectural intervention, as a network of objects in the landscape including the juxtaposition of the low-slung, one-storey massing and form of the structures expressed in their flat roofs with the dramatic natural environment of the Scarborough Bluffs.
&nbsp;
Key aspects of the interior design are highlighted by a creative and sensitive use of natural light using the composition of structural and architectural elements, including the clerestory of windows, sunken living room, wood encased steel structural grid, stone fireplace and the rice paper panelled doors
&nbsp;
Associative and Historical Value
The McNeel House at 125 Sylvan Avenue is valued for its historical association with the life and work of Dr. Burdett Harrison McNeel, who along with his wife Helen B. McNeel, commissioned and owned the home from 1963 to 1994. A Second World War veteran whose service during the Allied liberation of Europe focused upon treating soldiers suffering from battle exhaustion and shellshock, Dr. McNeel was a pioneer in the field of modern medicine and mental health. The McNeel's residence and the site of Dr. McNeel's private practice, the home holds a close connection to its original owners.
&nbsp;
The McNeel House also has significant historical value for its direct association with the life and remarkable career of architect James Murray. Murray was a Toronto-based Modernist architect, professor of architecture, and co-founder and long-time editor of Canadian Architect magazine, whose prolific career had an immense impact upon the trajectory of Modern architecture in Canada during the mid-twentieth century.
&nbsp;
Murray designed one of Toronto's first Modernist homes for James A. Daly, president of Maclean-Hunter, located at 1 Brendan Road nearby the architect's 1947-built residence at 6 Heathridge Park in Bennington Heights (demolished). Murray designed several custom-built homes, of which the McNeel House is a rare surviving example, using his signature Modernist design cues, including the careful placement of the home in its natural setting, the use of straight lines, the home's broad, horizontal massing, and the inclusion of a prominent covered walkway leading to the front door as also found at the 1963-built Shoicet House at 21 Park Lane Circle in the Bridle Path (demolished).
&nbsp;
With award-winning designs for public, commercial, and residential architecture across the city, Murray's work within the post-war, suburban enclaves of North York, Scarborough, and elsewhere, shaped the evolution of Toronto's pre-amalgamation boroughs. Murray won several awards and medals as a student and during his career, including a Royal Architectural Institute of Canada award (1940), British Association for the Advancement of Science award (1942), Massey Silver Medal (1958), Canadian Housing Design Council award (1969), and the Ontario Association of Architect's Order of Da Vinci (1988). A long-time associate with fellow Canadian Modernists John B. Parkin, John C. Parkin, and Henry Fliess, Murray's work within newly developed areas such as Don Mills greatly influenced the evolution of Canadian Modernism.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The McNeel House at 125 Sylvan Avenue has contextual value in relation to its role in defining, maintaining, and supporting the post-war, Garden City, character of Scarborough Village. The majority of the first generation of homes in the neighbourhood, built in the 1950s and '60s, are typical of several related, Modernist, suburban house- form typologies, including bungalows and split-levels. To these ends, the custom-designed McNeel House reflects many of the core aesthetic qualities shared by its neighbours, its broad, horizontal massing, use of straight lines, materiality, and incorporation of touchstone Modernist elements such as the carport and covered walkway, visually and functionally tying the home to its neighbours.
&nbsp;
Physically, functionally, and visually, the McNeel House at 125 Sylvan Avenue has additional contextual value for its careful placement atop the Scarborough Bluffs. Situated at an angle to the street, the property is picturesquely nestled onto its lake view lot, allowing it to blend into its natural surroundings.

&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
Completed in 1897, the three-storey hotel located at the south-west corner of Queen Street East and Sherbourne Street was completed for property owner George J. Foy who oversaw a wholesale wine, liquors and cigars business on Front Street East. According to the 1898 city directory, hotel keeper Frantz J. Kormann operated the &ldquo;Kormann House&rdquo; on-site. The subject property was listed on the City's Heritage Register in 2007 as the Kormann House Hotel. Many residents may better know the building by its later name, Canada House Hotel or Tavern, which it maintained for nearly 80 years before closing its doors for good in the early 1990s.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The Kormann House Hotel has design value as a representative example of a late-19th century corner hotel, typical of those found at major intersections in Toronto. Its design is highlighted by a chamfered corner, the application of Classical detailing, and the varied fenestration associated with the late-19th century Renaissance Revival style. Defining architectural features include the building's cornice, stepped parapet above the roofline and decorative corbelled brickwork.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The Kormann House Hotel is valued for its association with the late-19th century community which developed around this section of Queen Street as an urban townscape combining industrial, commercial and residential functions, lining one of the city's major cross-routes. It is valued for its historic association with Queen Street, the original boundary between the ten-block Town of York established in 1793 and the Park Lots estates to the north, and for its association with the history and development of the King-Parliament neighbourhood in the late-19th century.
&nbsp;
The building at 229 Queen Street East is valued for its association with the architect, John Wilson Sidall. Between 1893 and 1932, Sidall designed numerous institutional, ecclesiastical, commercial and residential buildings in Toronto between 1893 and 1932 and made significant contributions to the City&rsquo;s built form. Siddall&rsquo;s works are characterized by their blended styles, as is also evidenced in the design of the subject property at 229 Queen Street East.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
Contextually, this three-storey, Victorian-era brick hotel maintains the scale, form and massing and materiality of this section of Queen Street East, particularly between Mutual Street and Seaton Street. Located on the north edge of the King-Parliament Secondary Plan Area which contains the historic 1793 Town of York, it supports the character of the area as it represents the late-nineteenth-century development of the neighbourhood with commercial/residential and industrial buildings and consistent urban street walls.
&nbsp;
Situated prominently at the south-west corner of Queen Street East (originally known as Lot Street), which separated the Town to the south from Park Lot estates to the north, and Sherbourne Street, the Kormann House Hotel anchors this historically important intersection and is physically, visually and historically linked to its surroundings alongside the neighbouring heritage properties at the Thomas J. Wilkie Block (167-185 Queen Street East, 1886-1887) and the Carlyle Block (234-242 Queen Street East, 1892-1893).
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 1 Weatherell Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design/physical, historical/associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
Anchoring the southwest corner of Weatherell Street and Armadale Avenue within the Bloor West Village neighbourhood, the property at 1 Weatherell contains a one-storey bungalow completed in 1923. Designed by the prolific Toronto-born architect, Henry Simpson (1865-1926), the Craftsman-style dwelling served as Simpson's private home in the final years of his life. Simpson's previous private residence designed by the architect himself and located at 7 Triller Avenue (1912) also employs the Craftsman style and has been recognized on the City's Heritage Register since 1980.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Physical and Design Value
The property at 1 Weatherell Street is valued as a representative example of the bungalow building type, clad in red brick and designed by the architect-owner, Henry Simpson, in the Craftsman style. It contains defining features of the style including a mid-pitched gable roof with half-timbering, an asymmetrical design with its covered and arched main entrance porch opening onto the south and east elevations, wooden brackets and exposed wooden rafters below the eaves, leaded glass windows and flared, buttress-like corner columns on the south elevation.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The property is valued for its association with Toronto-born architect, Henry Simpson (1865-1926), who was a significant designer in Toronto through the late 19th and early 20th century, designing countless buildings for institutional, corporate and private clients. Trained under E.J. Lennox and having brief partnerships with Charles J. Gibson, James Ellis and Robert M. Young, he was primarily a sole practitioner. Notable works by Simpson during his career include Cooke's Church (1891, demolished) where he was an avid member and the Metallic Roofing Company factory and Beaux-Arts style showroom (1896), the latter having been designated a National Historic Site in 1985 and moved from its original location at King and Dufferin Streets to Atlantic Avenue the following year.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 1 Weatherell was built at the end of Simpson's career as a practicing architect and is believed to have been designed for his personal use in retirement, likely reflected in the size and accessibility of the house and layout. His enjoyment of the house was short lived as he died at 62 years, three years after the house was built.
&nbsp;
The property also yields information that contributes to the understanding of the historical development and suburban expansion of Toronto and the residential and commercial growth along Bloor Street West in the early 20th century, as part of the wave of development that occurred following the annexation of The Junction to the City of Toronto in 1909. The inclusion of an attached garage in the design of the subject property signals the suburban context and emerging automobile culture that would come to define the Bloor West Village area by the mid-20th century.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
The Henry Simpson House defines, maintains, and supports the early-20th century residential character in the western portion of Bloor West Village, north of Bloor Street West. The property's early-20th century date of construction is consistent with the neighbourhood while also defining itself as a unique, architect-owned and designed dwelling situated on a corner lot amongst more typical and uniformly-designed subdivision houses.
&nbsp;
The property is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings in the residential area of Bloor West Village just northwest of the Jane and Bloor intersection where its Craftsman-style design and detailing at once references and sets it apart from the other 1920s houses, as well as townhouses and institutional buildings of later periods on the street. Representing the earliest period of the subdivision of Registered Plan 1676, its elevated design is an important component in the built form history and evolution of its immediate neighbourhood.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
The property at 18 Portland Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design/physical, historical/associative, and contextual values.
&nbsp;
Description
The subject property at 18 Portland Street is located near the southeast corner of Niagara Street and Portland Street just south of Victoria Memorial Square within the King-Spadina neighbourhood. The former Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems Ltd. substation at 18 Portland Street, or Portland Substation, was designed in 1924-25 by the public utility's in-house architect Albert E. Salisbury (1887-1955) and completed in 1925. Similar to others in a collection of more than twenty substations designed by Salisbury between 1921 and 1950, the Portland Substation was designed in the Beaux-Arts tradition and features Edwardian Classical influences. Within that collection, it is recognizable as a two-storey, brick, factory/warehouse type building as well as for its metal entablature and sign band.
&nbsp;
Design and Physical Value
18 Portland Street holds significant design value as a representative example of a 1920s-era Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems Ltd. substation in the Beaux-Arts style with Edwardian Classical influences. Distinctive features include the two-storey scale, form and massing of the property, its common bond brick exterior with decorative stone detailing, fenestration openings with stone sills and multi-paned, metal factory type windows, terracotta coping along the parapet of the flat roof, and the metal entablature containing the name band sign reading: ""TORONTO HYDRO-ELECTRIC SYSTEM."" The sign band held within the metal entablature is composed of projecting, stamped, metal lettering with distinctive font common to other contemporary Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems Ltd. substations.
&nbsp;
The principal (east) elevation, true to the principles of the Beaux-Arts tradition, features a largely symmetrical fa&ccedil;ade, its two-over-two configuration composed by the pairings of the first-storey window and principal entryway and the two second-storey windows above.
&nbsp;
Historical and Associative Value
The Portland Substation at 18 Portland Street holds significant historical value for its century-long association with Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems Ltd. The Portland Substation forms part of the public utility's collection of early twentieth-century substations which were built across the city following its formation in 1911. This historical association is clearly expressed by the metal entablature and name band sign, with its distinctive typecast, identifying Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems Ltd. and referencing its former use.
&nbsp;
The Portland Substation also holds significant associative value as a reflection of the work of architect Albert E. Salisbury (1887-1955), who designed more than twenty substations between 1921 and 1950 as Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems Ltd.'s Supervisor of Architecture.&nbsp; Salisbury is considered an architect of significance to Toronto's early twentieth-century history. The Portland Substation is architecturally similar to others designed by Salisbury in the 1920s and 1930s, including its near-twin at 281 Cherry Street. It is representative of Salisbury's expressive use of the Beaux-Arts tradition, adapted with Edwardian Classical influences.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
18 Portland Street has significant contextual value related to its importance in maintaining and supporting the early twentieth-century industrial character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood. Built within an industrial setting as the face of the public utility, the substation's Edwardian Classical details bring further contextual value to the property both for its association with the larger network of substations across the city and for its connection to its immediate surroundings. Featuring red-brick masonry, fenestration openings with stone sills and multi-light, metal, factory type windows, terracotta coping, metal entablature with name band, and symmetrical fa&ccedil;ade, the two-storey Portland Substation is visually linked to nearby former-industrial buildings, including the Copp Clark Publishing Co complex at 517 Wellington Street West.
&nbsp;
Additionally, the Portland Substation is functionally and historically linked to its surroundings as a structure that was built in 1925 to support the increasing electric power requirements of the King-Spadina neighbourhood.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes
Design and Physical Value
Attributes that contribute to the design and physical cultural heritage value of the Portland Substation at 18 Portland Street:

The scale, form, and massing, of the two-storey, early twentieth-century, factory/warehouse type building expressive of the Beaux-Arts tradition with Edwardian Classical influences
The property's material palette, consisting of a common bond brick exterior with stone detailing
The symmetrical fa&ccedil;ade of the principal (east) elevation with its two-over-two configuration created by the pairing of the window and principal entryway (since altered) at street level and the two second-storey windows above
The factory type, metal windows on the first and second floors of the principal (east) elevation and side (south) elevation with stone sills and brick headers
The terracotta tile coping on the parapet of the flat roof.
The metal entablature on the principal (east) elevation with sign band reading: ""TORONTO HYDRO-ELECTRIC SYSTEM,"" supported by slightly projecting brick pilasters at the north and south edges of the facade

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The property at 551 Mount Pleasant Road (including entrance addresses at 549, 553 and 555 Mount Pleasant Road), is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design/physical, historical/associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 551 Mount Pleasant Road is situated in Toronto's midtown, on the east side of Mount Pleasant Road between Belsize Drive and Manor Road East. It contains the Regent Theatre, a neighbourhood theatre from the interwar era that was constructed in 1927 to the designs of architect Murray Brown. Originally named the Belsize Theatre, it opened as part of the Famous Players chain and was designed to host both vaudeville and film entertainment. The physical presence of both stage and screen facilitated the adaptation between the two mediums on more than one occasion since the building's initial construction, contributing to its longevity as a community asset. The distinguishable roofscape of the brick and stone building, the marquee, and the projecting signage identify the property as a theatre, making it a recognizable local landmark. The property includes two integrated storefronts on the principal elevation, contributing to the intact historic village streetscape of this section of Mount Pleasant Road, as identified in the Midtown in Focus Planning Study. The property was listed on the City's Heritage Register in 1984.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
The building at 551 Mount Pleasant Road is a representative example of an early 20th-century purpose-built vaudeville theatre along a neighbourhood main street, which were once common but are becoming increasingly rare. The two-storey scale at the property line with increased massing at the rear, the brick cladding with stone detailing, and the assimilation of the building into the contiguous commercial streetscape through the inclusion of two integrated storefronts are all characteristic of this typology. The use of Classical design language to project a sense of refinement is in keeping with the design tradition of vaudeville theatres, and is evident in the symmetrical arrangement of the fa&ccedil;ade, round-arched windows, and carved stone details. The roofline of the gabled centre bay flanked by flat-roofed sections to either side reinforces the focus on the marquee and projecting sign, which are also an integral part of the theatre typology. The design tradition of vaudeville theatre is also expressed on the interior of the building, including the surviving lobby ceiling that remains a tangible link to the original spatial arrangement and interior ornamentation of the Belsize Theatre.
&nbsp;
The subject property at 551 Mount Pleasant Road is valued for its association to the Crest Theatre (1953-1966), a highly influential repertory theatre company that helped to spotlight Canadian talent and establish the careers of a generation of theatre actors and playwrights. At the time the Crest Theatre was established, the Royal Alexandra Theatre was the only other permanent, year-round venue for live performance in the city, and the film industry was undergoing transition with the advent of television, leading many local cinemas to close. The Crest Theatre's founders, brothers Murray and Donald Davis, selected the theatre at 551 Mount Pleasant both for its location and because it had originally been constructed to host vaudeville entertainment, which facilitated the conversion to accommodate live performance. The Crest Hour Theatre, a touring company associated with the Crest Theatre, traveled to high schools across Ontario, further extending the cultural impact and legacy of the company.
&nbsp;
The subject property at 551 Mount Pleasant Road is also valued for its association with the architect Murray Brown (1884-1958). The Belsize Theatre at 551 Mount Pleasant Road was among the earliest of several theatres designed by Brown between 1926 and 1940. Brown is celebrated for his work on Canada's only surviving atmospheric theatre, the Capitol Theatre in Port Hope (1930) and Postal Station 'K' in Toronto (1936), and is a recipient of the Ontario Association of Architects' Honor Roll, which is only bestowed upon those who have made a significant contribution to the province's architectural heritage, either through their body of work or their influence in the wider community of design, education, and/or publication.
&nbsp;
Contextually, the predominantly two-storey height of the subject property, the delineated bays along the front elevation, and the ground floor storefronts with recessed entries serve to maintain the historical low-rise streetscape and consistent fine-grained rhythm of building frontages along Mount Pleasant Road between Davisville and Eglinton avenues. Located within the Glebe Manor Estate subdivision, the property supports the character of the area as it represents the early-20th century development of the neighbourhood as part of a prominent village main street in North Toronto.
&nbsp;
The building at 551 Mount Pleasant Road is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting, anchoring the east side of Mount Pleasant Road between Belsize Drive to the south and Manor Road East to the north. It is part of a contiguous row of commercial buildings with a shared setback constructed during the late 1920s following the introduction of public transit along Mount Pleasant Road.
&nbsp;
The contextual value of the former Belsize/Crest/Regent Theatre at 551 Mount Pleasant is also attributed to its role as a local landmark. The prominence of the building on the east side of Mount Pleasant Road is demonstrated through the larger massing at rear; gabled roofline and chimney that extend above the continuous streetwall height; and the projections into the public realm related to the building's historical use as a theatre, including a vertically-oriented sign at the second floor and a marquee and canopy above the front entrance, which have evolved over time.
&nbsp;

Explanatory note
District Designation By-Law
On September 28, 2022, Toronto City Council adopted By-law No.1218-2022 which designated the area shown on the map attached to this note as the Parkdale Main Street Heritage Conservation District (the District) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act (the Act). The By-law also adopts the Heritage Conservation District Plan, dated May 2022.
&nbsp;
Alterations to Property
The purpose of By-law No. 1218-2022 is to maintain the heritage character of the Parkdale Main Street Heritage Conservation District. This is accomplished by requiring certain alterations to buildings within the District to conform to District Objectives, Policies and Guidelines which are included in the District Plan. Typically, these alterations only relate to portions of the property that are visible from the public realm. For example, no heritage permit is required for exterior work that is not visible from the public realm, interior work, painting, and repairs using the same materials. If the proposal conforms to the District Objectives, Policies and Guidelines it can be approved by staff. Applications that do not conform to the District Objectives, Policies and Guidelines will be referred to City Council for consideration.
&nbsp;
Demolition and Infill Development
Under By-law 1218-2022, owners of property are required to apply for a heritage permit before demolishing any building in the District. Demolition applications are referred to City Council for consideration. If City Council refuses the permit, the applicant may appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal. New (infill) construction must contribute to the heritage character of the District, as per the District Plan.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 415 Broadview Avenue, St. John's Presbyterian Church, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
Located in the Riverdale neighbourhood at the north-east corner of Broadview Avenue and Simpson Avenue, just north of Gerrard Street East, the property at 415 Broadview Avenue (St. John's Presbyterian Church) contains a church and Sunday school wing designed in the Neo-Gothic style by architect Andrew Sharp and constructed in 1907. Founded in 1886, the congregation constructed its first church at Gerrard Street East and Bolton Avenue two years later. After enlarging the original church twice, the congregation acquired land at the northeast corner of Broadview Avenue and Simpson Avenue in 1904, with construction of the present edifice commencing in 1907.&nbsp; The new church and Sunday School were dedicated on January 5, 1908. Now celebrating 115 years in its current location, St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church continues to serve the Riverdale community.
&nbsp;
The subject property was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2009.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Designed in the Neo-Gothic style, St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church has design value as a representative example of an ecclesiastical building that displays a high degree of craftsmanship. Following the turn of the 20th century and a return to more simplified architectural designs, Neo-Gothic styling was popular for religious and educational buildings. With its monochromatic surfaces, overall balance, and less ostentatious medieval details including sparse religious symbolism, the style differs from the more elaborate Gothic Revival designs of the previous century. St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church displays Neo-Gothic elements with the symmetrical organization of the principal (west) elevation, the mixture of pointed-arch and segmental-arched openings, and the central, spireless tower with a decorative octagonal turret at its south-east corner.
&nbsp;
The Sunday School wing at the east end of the church proper continues the Neo-Gothic styling and complements the church design with its similarly segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings and two-storey, tower-like projecting bay surmounted by a crenellated parapet with single embrasure on the south elevation. The eastern-most, two-bay portion of the Sunday School wing was added in 1914 and designed to seamlessly blend in with the style and materiality of the 1907 building.
&nbsp;
The interior of the church is also representative of the Neo-Gothic style.&nbsp; This is evident in the vaulted form of the ceiling with its corbel brackets supporting curved beams, the second floor gallery area that curves around the south, west and north interior elevations, the stained glass windows with their illustrations and wood tracery, the raised floor height and altar screen at the east end to distinguish the hierarchy of the chancel over the nave, the wooden pews in the nave (including the gallery) the chancel chairs and pulpit, the wood panelling and the carved wood altar and baptismal font.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The property at 415 Broadview Avenue has associative value as the site of St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church, an institution of importance to the Riverdale community for 115 years. Through its social justice work, the congregation has supported local agencies and people in need, and provided funding for projects in Africa, including wells, AIDS research and hunger elimination.
&nbsp;
St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church is associated with Reverend John McPherson Scott (1859-1920), a person of significance to the Presbyterian community as he was a missionary and a pastor for 31 years at the congregation of St. John's Presbyterian Church, Riverdale, and oversaw the construction of the current church building completed in 1907. As part of his missionary work, Rev. Dr. Scott established the controversial Presbyterian Mission to the Jews in the Ward in 1908. Upon Scott's death in 1920 the mission evolved to become the Scott Institute with a broader community outreach program and subsequently the Scott Mission commemorating Rev. Dr. Scott in name. The Scott Mission continues to function as a Christian, non-denominational, urban mission which has provided significant community outreach services for over 80 years.
&nbsp;
The church is also linked to the practice of Scottish-born architect Andrew Sharp (1875-1966), who immigrated to Canada in 1900 following studies at the Glasgow School of Art.&nbsp; By 1902, he was chief designer in the office of Darling and Pearson, who were among Toronto&rsquo;s best-known architects in the early 20th century.&nbsp; During his tenure with the firm that lasted until 1910, Sharp&rsquo;s projects included Convocation Hall at the University of Toronto (1907). His name appears on the building permit issued for St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church in March 1907. After leaving Darling and Pearson, Sharp embarked on a brief solo practice when he prepared the plans for St. Aidan&rsquo;s Anglican Church (1910) at Queen Street East and Silver Birch Avenue (which is recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register).&nbsp; During a short-lived partnership with the Ottawa-based architect, James Hodge Brown, Sharp entered competitions for municipal buildings across Canada and, in 1911, designed Deer Park Presbyterian Church (later Deer Park United Church) in Toronto.
&nbsp;
Located at the north-east corner of Broadview Avenue and Simpson Avenue, St. John's Presbyterian Church is important as it defines and maintains and supports the institutional character of the intersection, which also includes the former Don Jail, a city-wide landmark, the Riverdale Library (1910) and the former Bank of Ottawa Branch (1911). Including the church at 415 Broadview Avenue, all of these adjacent properties are recognized on the City's Heritage Register.
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1907 and dedicated the following January, St. John's Presbyterian Church is visually, historically and functionally linked to its surroundings as it is forms part of the built form evolution and growth of the Riverdale community since the congregation's founding in 1888, just four years following annexation of the community to the City of Toronto.
&nbsp;
St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church is also valued as a local landmark on the northeast corner of Broadview Avenue and Simpson Avenue in Riverdale. With its position on a prominent corner lot, St. John&rsquo;s Presbyterian Church is viewed from Broadview Avenue, Gerrard Street East, and the adjoining residential neighbourhood.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 63 Old Forest Hill Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
Located on the east side of Old Forest Hill Road just south of the junction with Dunvegan Road and Browside Avenue, the property at 63 Old Forest Hill Road is part of a collection of grand residential properties in the Forest Hill neighbourhood, several of them designed by the same architect, Douglas E. Kertland. By providing a cohesive architectural character through their shared qualities of scale, form and massing, materials and details typical of the 1920s and 1930s, these properties create a sense of place. The Arts and Crafts movement house with Tudor Revival styling was originally owned by Canadian automotive industrialist George W. McLaughlin's daughter, Dorothy, who resided there for nearly twenty years. The house was subsequently owned by businessman, Paul D. Phelan until his passing in 2021.
&nbsp;
The subject property was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1975.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
&nbsp;
Design or Physical Value
&nbsp;
The Dorothy (McLaughlin) Tait House has design value as an excellent representative of a grand Tudor Revival style dwelling whose design reflects Arts and Crafts movement principles. The Arts and Crafts elements are present in the picturesque composition of the asymmetrical building massing and elevations, the combination of steeply pitched gabled and hipped clay tile roofs with dormers and dominant chimneys, the recessed entry porch and projecting oriel and bay windows, the flat-headed window openings and the cladding which combines rough-cut wood around the window openings, and half-timbering on highly decorative red brickwork in various patterns. The Tudor Revival is seen in the broad Tudor arch of the principal entry opening and wooden door with ornate metal detailing, the copper gutters, downspouts and light fixtures, and the half-timbering with carved columns, cornice lines and bargeboards. The situation of the house on its property with its long, south elevation facing the garden and the narrower, west elevation facing Old Forest Hill Road is characteristic of the informal quality of the Arts and Crafts architecture which responds to the site's topography and orientation. This unusual arrangement is enhanced by the intentional diagonal entry to an elliptical drive which creates a north-east route to the principal entrance with its stone and landscaped terrace.
&nbsp;
The house displays a high degree of artistic merit in the complexity of the overall building massing, the combination of multiple gable and hipped clay tile roofs punctuated with a variety of dormers and extended chimneys with their clustered and corbeled red brick flues, and in the wealth of detail seen in the materials including rough stone, a variety of brick pattern work and half timbering, and the range of door and window opening combinations. A high level of craftsmanship is present in the skilled carpentry required to construct the complex roof-scape and carved wooden detailing, and in the masonry with its random patterns of various shades and shapes of rough-hewn stone.
&nbsp;
Historical or Associative Value
The property has historic value for its direct association with the Canadian auto industry magnate McLaughlin family, including former Vice President of General Motors of Canada, George W. McLaughlin, and his daughter, Dorothy Marion for whom he purchased the property in 1934 and commissioned the existing house to the designs of the important local architect, Douglas Kertland.
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1934, shortly after the incorporation of Forest Hill Village, the property at 63 Old Forest Hill Road contributes to an understanding of the early history of Forest Hill as a residential enclave whose early design by-laws and practices resulted in the carefully crafted, landscaped neighbourhood still evident today.
&nbsp;
The property is representative of the important architect Douglas E. Kertland, who is known for winning the competition to design the CNE's Automotive Building (1928-9). Kertland's residential architecture was widely published from the mid-1920s to the 1940s and he designed at least six other grand homes adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Dorothy M. McLaughlin House in Forest Hill.
&nbsp;
Contextual Value
&nbsp;
Situated on the east side of Old Forest Hill Road just south of the junction with Dunvegan Road and Browside Avenue, the subject property maintains and supports the character of the neighbourhood. It is one in a series of grand Arts and Crafts houses with Tudor Revival style details sharing a two-storey scale with complex asymmetrical massing and a unified mix of materials featuring stone, brick, wood and metal in a consistent landscaped and well-treed setback.
&nbsp;
Constructed in 1934, as one of a number of Kertland-designed houses in the neighborhood, and as a part of the development of Forest Hill Village, the property at 63 Old Forest Hill Road is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.
&nbsp;
Heritage Attributes

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 127 Strachan Avenue, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design/physical, historical/associative and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
The property at 127 Strachan Avenue is located in Toronto's West Queen West neighbourhood, prominently situated on the southeast corner of Strachan Avenue and Adelaide Street West. It contains a three storey mixed-use commercial building that dates to 1878. In 1999, alterations to the building resulted in a reconfiguration of the storefront. The building was originally constructed as a grocery for John H. Meyer, a former hotel proprietor, to support the surrounding working-class neighbourhood. It continued to operate primarily as a grocery until the 1950s. More recently, it has served as a restaurant with a popular summer patio on the north side of the building.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1878, the property at 127 Strachan Avenue has design and physical value as a representative example of the Second Empire architectural style that was popular in many prominent commercial, public, and residential buildings in Toronto from 1860 to 1900. The property retains its original scale, form, and massing as a three-storey building with a one-storey rear wing, and its design value as a representative example of the Second Empire style is reflected in many of its extant original features, including its brick construction with ornamental brick, wood, and stone details, segmental-arched windows on the north and west elevations, mansard roof supported by a bracketed cornice, and round-arched dormers. Although altered and presently overclad, the building also retains the distinguishing feature of a commercial storefront at grade, differentiating this building from the surrounding residential properties.
&nbsp;
The subject property at 127 Strachan Avenue is valued for its association with the architect David Brash Dick (1846-1925). With architectural drawings dating to 1877, it is one of the earliest recorded buildings he designed as the sole contributing architect. During his career, Dick established himself as the architect of choice for several prominent clients including the Consumers' Gas Company and the University of Toronto, and is a recipient of the Ontario Association of Architects' Honor Roll, which is only bestowed upon those who have made a significant contribution to the province's architectural heritage, either through their body of work or their influence in the wider community of design, education, and/or publication.
&nbsp;
Contextually, the building at 127 Strachan Avenue supports and maintains the historic character of the working-class neighbourhood that developed in the late 19th century and thrived due to the proximity of several large industrial complexes established near the railway. The property's materiality, scale and massing contribute to the low-rise residential streetscape, which has been reinforced through the introduction of several compatible infill projects along Strachan Avenue.
&nbsp;
The building at 127 Strachan Avenue is also historically, visually and physically linked to its setting, anchoring the southeast corner of Strachan Avenue and Adelaide Street West. The property was one of the last buildings to be erected as part of the initial build-out of the neighbourhood in the 1870s, and was centrally located within the residential enclave on a prominent corner site. Relative to the surrounding house-form buildings, the larger scale and higher-quality materials used in its design and construction are indications of the commercial nature of the property and its important role in serving the local residential community.

&nbsp;
Reasons for Designation
&nbsp;
The property at 94 Isabella Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under the categories of design/physical value, historical/associative value, and contextual value.
&nbsp;
Description
&nbsp;
The subject property at 94 Isabella Street consists of a house-form building located on the north side of Isabella Street, west of Jarvis Street. The building measures two-and-a-half storeys with a raised basement constructed in rusticated stone, red brick at the first storey, and shingled cladding at the second storey on the south (primary) elevation, wrapping around to the sides. Set back behind a landscaped lawn with a short gate, the building lacks a primary entry on the front elevation and is instead accessed by a door on the west elevation.
&nbsp;
The building's design represents the Queen Anne Revival style. Characterized by an eclectic and picturesque application of varied historical influences, the style originated in the 1860s in England and by the 1880s had grown popular within Canadian residential architecture. Key stylistic components of the subject property's design include the asymmetrical composition of each of its elevations, the irregular roofline featuring gables and corbelled brick chimneys, and the varied textures of its material palette.
&nbsp;
Along with the adjacent designated properties at 90-92 Isabella Street, and a number of properties in the vicinity along Jarvis Street, the subject property contributes to a layer of built fabric reflecting the area's early development for the residences of prominent Torontonians.
&nbsp;
The Helen E. McMaster House was listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1981.
&nbsp;
Statement of Cultural Heritage Value
Constructed in 1884-1885, the Helen E. McMaster House is an intact, representative example of a Queen Anne Revival-style residence. Characterized by an eclectic and picturesque application of varied historical influences, the style originated in the 1860s in England and by the 1880s had grown popular within Canadian residential architecture. Key stylistic components of the subject property's design include the asymmetrical composition of its elevations, the irregular roofline featuring gables and corbelled brick chimneys, the varied textures of its material palette, oriel and bay windows, and details such as wood brackets and bargeboards.
&nbsp;
The property demonstrates the work of Edmund Burke (1850-1919), of the architectural firm of Langley &amp; Burke. Burke was a prolific and influential architect in Toronto, known for his versatility and application of new building technologies. Noted for its Queen Anne Revival-style design and precedential use of shingled cladding, the Helen E. McMaster House reflects Burke's approach to prominent residential commissions in the late nineteenth century.
&nbsp;
The property is important in maintaining and supporting the character of the area along Isabella Street and continuing along Jarvis Street. Representing the popular residential styles of the time, including Queen Anne Revival style at 94 Isabella Street and at the properties to the immediate west, these remaining house-form buildings are characterized by fine architectural detailing and deeper landscaped setbacks, as seen at the subject property. The property is also visually and historically linked to its surroundings. Along with the adjacent designated properties at 90-92 Isabella Street, and a number of properties in the vicinity along Jarvis Street, the subject property contributes to a layer of built fabric reflecting the area's early development for the residences of prominent Torontonians.
