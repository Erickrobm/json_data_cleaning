# Cleaning & Converting Data from a JSON file into a CSV
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with a script for cleaning and converting data from the JSON file into a CSV format that is more user-friendly. The script performs various data cleaning tasks such as removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and converting data types to make the data more consistent and usable. The cleaned data is then exported to a CSV file, which can be easily imported into a spreadsheet or other data analysis tool.

## Make sure to run it with:
```
    python==3.7.3
    numpy==1.22.3
    pandas==1.4.2
```
